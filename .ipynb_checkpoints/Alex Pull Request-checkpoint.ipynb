(kas roussy/cbc) given that china and india produce 80 per cent of the active ingredients of prescription drugs sold in north america, supply disruptions are expected eventually, duffin said. \"i think that the coronavirus outbreak is a big wake-up call for us to pay attention to our drug shortages that exist already and to pay attention to where our drugs come from,\" she said. what you need to know about getting new prescriptions, refillsnew brunswick offers relief on prescription co-pays during outbreak india, a major supplier of generic drugs to europe, has already shut down the export of some antibiotics and drugs for hypertension, blood pressure and acetaminophen, duffin said. as a precaution, the federal government has enacted sweeping legislation that gives it the right to force patented drugmakers to make more medicine if necessary and remove patents as part of the response to the public health emergency.\\xa0'"

home at rideau cottage to explain why the federal government has not invoked the emergencies act. canadians perceive the covid-19 pandemic to be an emergency and rightly so. the problem is that the act can only be employed when an emergency rises above the ability of any one province to cope with the situation and there is, as a consequence, a risk to other provinces. the mere fact that there are different approaches to the pandemic across the country is not by itself sufficient to trigger the act. however, as the pandemic unfolds, it has been clear that our provinces are not able to ensure sufficient testing for covid-19. without this, there is no hope of notifying all those who have been exposed and, in turn, testing and – crucially – isolating them too, if positive. other countries, such as taiwan and south korea, have had success with taming covid-19 this way. it is only through this method that we can hope to eradicate nests of infection. otherwise, lock-down and social isolation measures will stalk us for months to come, wreaking unsustainable havoc on the economy and social and cultural life. the world health organization has urged countries to \"isolate, test, treat and trace.\" the provinces\\' inability to achieve high levels of testing and tracing collectively from coast to coast arguably is a sufficient ground for the federal government to trigger the emergencies act. prime minister justin trudeau addressed the nation tuesday, touching on legislation to help canadians during the covid-19 pandemic, stressing the need for social distancing and touching on his conversation with premiers about the federal emergency measures act. 21:55 the powers that the federal government has under the act include the \"establishment of emergency shelters and hospitals.\" this would allow canada to act swiftly to establish additional testing sites to support hospitals, deploying military and other public servants, as well as medical and nursing students, and possibly volunteers to supplement the already overtaxed health-care workforce. the government could further establish testing sites in rural remote and northern areas. trudeau says most premiers don\\'t think emergencies act needed yet to cope with covid-19the \\'measure of last resort\\': what is the emergencies act and what does it do? once a person tests positive and has been assigned appropriate care, the next step would be to trace and follow up with everyone the person has come in contact with. trying to do this the old-school way — calling folks up and talking to them about where, when and who — has already proven too slow for the fast-moving virus. for instance, old-school public health tracing was overwhelmed after a \"super-spreader\" infected thousands of people starting with a party in westport, ct. in contrast, south korea accessed people\\'s cellphone data to track their whereabouts in the days before they tested positive. then, tracers used the data on their phones to send messages to individuals whose phone data revealed they had been in the same spaces. the messages said: \"you need to be tested, immediately, to save lives.\" canada\\'s chief public health officer dr. theresa tam says some provinces have come up with innovative ways to tackle the spread of covid-19, but the best approach is still for everyone to respect social distancing. 1:10 in canada, not everybody has a cellphone, but close to 90 per cent do, and this approach could complement traditional tracing methods. under the act, the federal government could use the power to require, use or dispose of \"property\" in order to access data held by telecommunications companies. the next hurdle would be the federal privacy legislation, personal information protection and electronic documents act (pipeda), which prohibits companies from disclosing personal data without consent. it would be necessary to pass a new law — temporarily and only for the purpose of fighting covid-19 — to permit this. this law would, in turn, have to comply with the charter of rights and freedoms. trudeau leaves door open to using smartphone data to track canadians\\' compliance with pandemic rulespublic health can override privacy, but it\\'s not happening yet: privacy commissioner to succeed here, the federal government would need to show strong evidence of the need to ramp up testing and contact tracing. the chief public health officer would have to consider the imperative for testing and tracing, but also consider whether the disease is so widespread that widespread contact tracing, which works well with discrete chains of infection, may not have the desired effect. the federal government would also need to show it had implemented the strongest privacy protections it could in the circumstances, including limiting collection of data to covid-19-related purposes, for a specific period, providing safeguards for the use and disposal of the data, and ensuring consultation and possible oversight by the privacy commissioner. there are thousands of people waiting for results from a coronavirus test because the system handling them is overwhelmed. 2:14 it is better for the federal government to do this well and do it right for all canadians rather than to permit differences across provinces, particularly as tracing those who may have been infected may involve crossing provincial boundaries. whatever the federal government does in this space would require significant interactions and synergies between provincial governments and local public health units across the country. if canada were to invoke the emergencies act, it would be unprecedented. if canada were to use that power to ramp up testing and contact-tracing across canada, it would be unprecedented. and if canada were to require the use of data from our telecommunications companies to track the contacts of those infected with covid-19, it would be unprecedented. but we live in unprecedented times. this column is part of cbc\\'s opinion section. for more information about this section, please read our faq. prince charles, the heir to the british throne, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, his office said wednesday. the 71-year-old is showing mild symptoms of covid-19 and is self-isolating at a royal estate in scotland, his clarence house office said. it says his wife camilla, 72, has tested negative. \"the prince of wales has tested positive for coronavirus,\" clarence house said. \"he has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.\" watch: prince charles in self-isolation with covid-19 royal correspondent katie nicholl says buckingham palace has addressed concerns about the queen. 2:12 britain\\'s press association, citing a source, said the prince and the duchess remained in good spirits, and that charles was not bedridden. the tests were carried out by the national health service in scotland. \"it is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks,\" the clarence house statement said. the latestcoronavirus: what\\'s happening in canada and around the world march 25 queen in good health buckingham palace said queen elizabeth remains at her home in windsor. \"her majesty the queen remains in good health,\" the palace said. \"the queen last saw the prince of wales briefly after the investiture on the morning of 12th march and is following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare.\" charles\\'s last public engagement was march 12. he has had a number of private meetings, and participants at those sessions have been made aware of his condition. from shuttered businesses and empty offices to silent streets and crashing stock markets, the covid-19 pandemic has dramatically altered every aspect of daily life in alberta. as the number of cases continues to grow and sanctions intended to curb social interactions escalate, many albertans are wondering how best to protect themselves, and which every-day activities are still considered safe. dr. mark joffe joined edmonton am on monday to answer some of those questions. joffe is the vice-president and medical director for northern alberta at alberta health services. he is also a professor in the department of medicine at the university of alberta, where he\\'s also an adjunct professor in medical microbiology and immunology and the school of public health. here is that conversation, edited for clarity and length. q. is it still ok to go to recreational areas like the river valley trails that could be crowded? a. i was out walking in the river valley this weekend. i was actually quite impressed that most people, as they came toward me on the path, seemed to understand that they needed to remain about six feet away from me and i was certainly doing the same with them. it\\'s great being out in the fresh air and especially if there\\'s a little bit of wind blowing that would dilute any virus that might be in the air, that would be the safest you could possibly be. i am self-isolating and only going out to walk my dog. will i be able to continue if a quarantine is called? we\\'re going to have to look after our animals. they\\'re part of our families. we can\\'t ignore them. and i can\\'t really imagine that we\\'ll reach a point of quarantine where we won\\'t be able to take our animals out for a walk to do their business. i hope we don\\'t reach that point. being out in the great outdoors is actually the safest place to be as long as you\\'re six feet away from others walking outside. it couldn\\'t be any safer than that. new testing protocols give priority to at-risk populations. why was this change needed now? dr. mark joffe is the vice president and medical director for northern alberta at alberta health services. (cbc) we knew that, over time, we would have to look very carefully at our test strategies and that things would evolve. to date, the focus to date has been on returning travelers. we knew over time the number of travelers would gradually drop off as borders closed and as canadians returned home. we also knew that as the number of individuals impacted by covid-19 increased in our communities that we would have to refocus our attention. again the key thing is, individuals who get sick need to stay home. we don\\'t need a test to tell people to stay home. we will be focusing our testing more on vulnerable populations, particularly those in senior centres. we\\'re going to be focusing the testing more on essential service workers, particularly health care workers. it will be really important for us to know whether a healthcare worker with a mild fever or a cough has covid-19 or not. and if they do not have it, we\\'re going to want to get them back into the workforce as soon as their symptoms settle. my 74-year-old husband has a severe lung disease. is it safe for me to do our shopping or should i rely on the help of my neighbours? i would say that an individual who has serious underlying lung disease and is in their 70s is exactly this sort of individual that we want to protect from covid-19. i understand that your caller prefers to do her own shopping and wants to be out in public. she can certainly do so safely, if she maintains social distancing, cleans her hands frequently and clean surfaces frequently. she can go out and can do some of her household chores safely if she\\'s really attentive to detail. but i think this is a time that it would be reasonable to accept some help from others as well. if i go out shopping, is it safe to bring the items inside my home immediately? i think it\\'s certainly safe to bring things immediately inside if you wanted to. but you can take some extra precautions with articles that may come in packaging. for example, if you buy 12 rolls of toilet paper in wrapping, you could take the wrapping off outside and bring the individual rolls inside. any contamination would be on the outside surface. there may be surfaces that you could wipe down with a common household cleaner or disinfectant. with cardboard boxes in general, it\\'s a good idea to remove the items from the box and then bring any smaller items inside. what should people who are continuing to work in an office be doing to take extra precautions? it\\'s about the attention to detail and focusing on activities that we probably wouldn\\'t have thought much of before. it\\'s about social distancing, staying two meters away from others as much as possible. it\\'s about frequent hand cleaning. and if one is working in a cubicle-type environment, use cleaners or disinfectants to clean the high-touch surfaces frequently. it\\'s certainly possible to continue to go to work in that kind of an environment but it\\'s really about the attention to detail. many of the symptoms are similar to a flu or the common cold. at what point should i be concerned? by far the most common symptom with covid-19 is fever and just about everyone that develops covid-19 will have a fever. sometimes it\\'s not present right at the beginning but it will occur within the first day or two. that\\'s the most common thing. cough is the second most common. and so again it\\'s that combination of a fever and a cough. that should make individuals most concerned. there definitely are some other things that can occasionally be seen. muscle aches and pains and fatigue are fairly common as well. it\\'s that combination of symptoms, the onset of a fever with a cough that would be the most concerning. how airborne is the virus? what we know about this virus is that it\\'s spread in relatively large droplets that emerge from the mouth as people talk or particularly if they cough or sneeze those large droplets tend to settle out over about three feet possibly out to as much as six feet. that\\'s why we talk about social distancing. the virus is not airborne. it does not spread long distances through the air. what about air temperature? how does that impact transmission? i don\\'t think we fully understand this yet. we certainly know with some viruses they actually tend to prefer cold weather and low humidity, and as the temperature rises or the humidity rises, they may not survive as long in the environment. covid-19 cases in alberta have more than tripled in past week federal government warns of covid-19 enforcement measures alberta changes covid-19

windsor-essex health care workers need them london area health professionals are the first in the country to use a new online tool that promises to allow patients, doctors and health authorities collaborate and share information in the fight against the coronavirus on an unprecedented scale. the announcement was made on monday, the same day the province confirmed 78 new cases of the illness, bring the total number of cases in ontario to 503. the new numbers were followed by a sweeping order from premier doug ford, instructing all non-essential businesses to close in an effort to help contain the spread of the disease. as the virus infects more people, the designers say the software will allow local health authorities to better see the number and severity of covid-19 cases in the london region in real time from the patients themselves, while at the same time, empowering patients by putting a doctor\\'s knowledge directly into their hands. \"we all have a common enemy,\" said dr. daniel pepe, a london family physician with the london-lambeth medical clinic who worked on developing the software along with the middlesex-london health unit, the region\\'s hospitals and toronto-based software maker inputhealth. \\'this is a shield in front of our healthcare system\\' dr. daniel pepe is a family physician in london, ont.

(puneet seth/twitter) \"within our platform, there\\'s a powerful analytics engine that will allow you to visualize the responses, potential probable cases, how individuals are doing and give an incredible amount of data that will be valuable for public health officials,\" he said. being able to see and analyze what\\'s happening in real-time should, in theory, be able to prevent the kind of tragic situation that\\'s unfolding in italy, where the country\\'s hospitals have been inundated by severe cases and people are dying by the hundreds every day. seth said the online tool will not only help support patients through a complicated healthcare system, it will also bring their concerns to the appropriate places and provide the right kind of follow up. \"that kind of comprehensive model is what we think is really important for urgent population health management,\" he said. \"on one hand it\\'s inspiring, but at the same time we\\'re concerned.\" seth said hopefully it will empower people to help themselves and help others deal with the crisis effectively. \"at the end of the day the public and individuals do have control to be able to curb what\\'s happening.\" laurie pushor, saskatchewan\\'s deputy minister of energy and resources, is to take over the alberta energy regulator\\'s top job april 15. the agency is tasked with overseeing the development of the province\\'s oil, gas and coal resources in an environmentally responsible way. pushor takes over an agency in transition and an industry that is being crushed economically by the novel coronavirus and an oil price war between saudi arabia and russia. last week, alberta premier jason kenney began rolling out an aid package that includes the government paying the industry\\'s levies to the energy regulator for six months at a cost of $113 million. prior to the downturn, the regulator had already been overhauling management and staff at the direction of kenney\\'s government, which has said project approvals were taking far too long. a tentative agreement has been reached with british columbia\\'s 45,000 public school teachers. details of the contract won\\'t be released until after it\\'s ratified, although the government says the deal was reached under the guidelines of its sustainable services negotiating mandate. in 2019, that mandate included a two-per-cent wage increase over each of three years. the contract covers teachers who work in 60 b.c. school districts. a tweet from the b.c. teachers\\' federation (bctf) says the executive committee is recommending the agreement be accepted. after several days of marathon negotiation sessions this week, a tentative agreement between the bctf and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bced?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5etfw\">#bced</a> employer, bcpsea, has been reached. our executive committee is recommending the deal to the membership. an email with more info is on its way to members now.&mdash;@bctf the bctf said in the tweet that the deal had been reached after \"marathon\" negotiating sessions this week. the last deal between the bctf and the b.c. public school employers\\' association (bcpsea) expired in june of 2019. in the year of negotiations that followed, the bctf said it was focused on better wages to improve the province\\'s ability to attract teachers, to make up a shortfall. it also wanted equitable student learning conditions across school districts, like having equal access to resources, including special needs staff for vulnerable children who require extra learning or behavioural support. alan chell, the chair of the bcpsea board of directors, commended the two sides for working out a deal amid the coronavirus pandemic. classes in b.c. are currently suspended. \\'recognized need\\' \"with the challenges, concerns and priorities arising from the global covid-19 pandemic, we\\'re very pleased that both parties recognized the need to bring this round of bargaining to conclusion,\" said chell in a release. he is hopeful that education boards and teachers will ratify the agreement \"and that we can work together to focus on continuity of student learning, as well as the health and safety of our school communities.\" the bctf says it is emailing details of the agreement to its members thursday night. in a tweet, it said that, \"given the current circumstances with covid-19, our ratification vote will be different this time around and we are already working on what that will look like.\" most b.c. teachers will be back on the job monday — albeit from home — trying to figure out how to keep the learning going amid the social distancing demands brought on by the covid-19 pandemic. bctf president says salary, learning conditions key issues for teachers when mediated talks resume two-thirds of canadians think prime minister justin trudeau is doing a good job handling the covid-19 crisis, according to a recent poll. it\\'s a number that has grown larger over the course of the last few weeks. that still ranks him below some provincial premiers in this country, and some world leaders overseas. but not all of them. a survey published on thursday by the angus reid institute found 64 per cent of canadians think the federal government has done a good job handling the pandemic. that number is up six percentage points over a mar. 13-15 poll. and the number is very similar to another survey conducted by léger, which found 65 per cent of canadians satisfied with the performance of the federal government on this issue. according to the ari poll, however, more canadians in every region of the country thought their provincial governments were doing a good job. in ontario, 74 per cent of respondents reported that premier doug ford\\'s government was handling things well, a number that was also corroborated by the léger poll. but the highest score came in quebec, where 93 per cent of respondents said premier françois legault\\'s government was doing a good job. that is an extraordinarily high result — almost unbelievable. but even that score was backed up by the léger poll, which found a 94 per cent satisfaction rating for legault. that likely makes the quebec premier one of the most popular leaders in the world right now, despite the increase in cases in his province. on thursday, the number of confirmed cases in quebec grew to 1,629. that figure is higher than the ones being reported by any other province, or even some big countries such as japan. nevertheless, significantly more quebecers are satisfied with legault\\'s leadership than with trudeau\\'s. only 49 per cent of quebecers said they thought the federal government was doing a good job on coronavirus, according to the ari survey. trump getting a bump that\\'s about even with how many americans approve of the job u.s. president donald trump is doing on the pandemic. a recent yougov poll gave trump an approval rating of 49 per cent on his handling of the crisis, with 44 per cent disapproving (broadly in line with other surveys). that is a relatively good mark for trump and better than his overall approval rating. on thursday, his average approval rating hit 45 per cent, the highest it\\'s been since the first weeks of his presidency. still, trump\\'s numbers rank him quite low among major world leaders. how some world leaders score on a variety of recent polls about their management of the covid-19 pandemic. (cbc) a sampling of recent polls puts trudeau somewhere in the middle of the rankings of how citizens think their governments and leaders are managing the health emergency. merkel, conte, johnson rated highly one recent poll found 75 per cent of germans saying they are satisfied with how chancellor angela merkel\\'s government has managed the crisis. the country has more than 10 times as many confirmed cases as canada, but is also doing more testing than anywhere else in the world. nearly the same proportion of italians thought positively about the work the government of prime minister giuseppe conte was doing in their country, according to an instituto ixe survey conducted earlier this week. according to one recent poll, roughly three-quarters of italians approve of the job done by prime minister giuseppe conte on the covid-19 outbreak. (robert monaldo / associated press) italy is one of the worst-afflicted countries in the world, with nearly as many reported cases as china — where the first cases of the virus were reported — and more deaths. in the united kingdom, prime minister boris johnson has seen his favourability ratings move into positive territory for the first time since he took the job, and 70 per cent of u.k. residents told yougov they thought his government was handling the coronavirus well as it imposes more restrictions on the country. macron\\'s numbers fading but while leaders like trump, johnson and trudeau are receiving a bump in public opinion over their management of the crisis, others are taking a hit. french president emmanuel macron has been unpopular for most of his time in office, but his numbers were beginning to improve as the virus spread in his country. those numbers are now falling back down, with polls by ifop and elabe finding confidence in his government\\'s crisis management sliding. the elabe survey found just 44 per cent of french citizens thinking macron and his government were handling it well, compared to 56 per cent who thought it was managing things badly. in an earlier survey, 57 per cent of those polled said macron\\'s government was managing things well. french president emmanuel macron has seen his approval ratings related to his management of the covid-19 crisis decrease in recent days. (benoit tessier / associated press) the numbers are worse for mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador, who has persisted in holding mass rallies and has downplayed the significance of the pandemic. a recent poll for the reforma newspaper found just 37 per cent of mexicans approving of his management of the issue. undoubtedly, the social and economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will be enormous. but there will also be political consequences, though it\\'s too early to say just what they might be in the long term. for some leaders, however, it appears there could be opportunities in this crisis. update: on march 12, hong kong\\'s agriculture, fisheries & conservation department released a statement that said a blood test of a 17-year-old dog that was initially found to have a \"low-level infection\" of the coronavirus through other measures came back negative. on march 18, it was announced that the dog, which belonged to a patient with covid-19, had died. vets in hong kong said the stress and anxiety of being in quarantine while under examination may have been a contributing factor. read more here. the world health organization has said there is no evidence that pets can be infected with the coronavirus that causes covid-19. news that a dog tested positive for the coronavirus in hong kong likely set off alarm bells this week among pet owners. while there\\'s no indication the virus can spread to humans from dogs, some experts say there may be a need for quarantines among pets of owners who contract the virus. hong kong officials collected samples on feb. 26 from a dog of a patient who had covid-19 and found \"low levels\" of the coronavirus in its nose and mouth the following day. if you have a dog, cat or ferret, and you\\'re isolating at home, those animals should be isolated at home with you.- prof. j. scott weese, university of guelph\\'s ontario veterinary college followup tests determined the dog tested \"weak positive\" for the virus. then, international experts at the world organisation for animal health (oie) concluded the dog has some degree of infection, likely caused by human-to-animal transmission. \"i think this dog has a low level of infection,\" thomas sit, assistant director of the hong kong agriculture, fisheries & conservation department (afcd), said thursday. \"according to experts, it\\'s likely the human infected the dog.… sometimes animals infect humans and sometimes [it\\'s] the other way around.\" the dog, which is reportedly a 17-year-old pomeranian, has been in quarantine in hong kong under close surveillance, but has displayed no symptoms of the covid-19 illness. how did the dog get infected? prof. j. scott weese of the university of guelph\\'s ontario veterinary college, who studies diseases that can pass between animals and humans, said it was initially thought the dog became infected due to contamination from living in close contact with its owner. \"the fact that it was positive two days later and they weren\\'t calling it a \\'weak positive\\' the second time would suggest that it was more of a true positive that\\'s more consistent with the dog actually being infected,\" he said. \"the dog is clinically normal, which is good for the dog, but it also [shows] why we need to sort this out.\" why tracing the animal source of coronavirus matters dr. mike ryan, director of who\\'s emergency program, said it\\'s not unusual to find animals that can be \"transient hosts\" in infectious disease outbreaks, carrying the disease without spreading it. he said similar issues have been seen in the sars epidemic of 2003 and the ongoing mers outbreaks in the middle east. \"this dog is a victim...\" he said. \"we need to establish quite clearly what part animals might play in further transmission, but that is unknown.\" a dog wearing a face mask is seen in shanghai on march 2. (aly song/reuters) dr. william karesh, executive vice-president of the ecohealth alliance and a veterinarian based in new york working with the oie on this case, said it\\'s possible other animals could carry the virus. at least two cats were found to be carriers of sars after an outbreak in a hong kong apartment complex during the 2003 epidemic. cats, ferrets may be reservoir for sars \"they tested positive for sars because they were living with so many people that were infected,\" he said. \"but they never transmitted the disease to anyone. there was no evidence that they spread the disease.\" could the dog infect humans or other pets? the dog will be repeatedly tested over the coming days and hong kong officials say it will only be released after it tests negative. genetic tests are also reportedly being done on the coronavirus taken from the dog, to determine if it mutated after infection. \"we don\\'t have enough data to have a 100 [per cent] answer whether it\\'s infectious to other dogs or not,\" sit said. \"but if the dog owner is positive, it\\'s better to take precautionary measures to prevent onward transmission.\" a dog wearing a mask is seen in shanghai on feb. 16. (aly song/reuters) the world small animal veterinary association said in a statement that while tests revealed a small quantity of covid-19, they did not indicate whether there were \"intact virus particles\" that are infectious – or just fragments of the genetic material that are not contagious. \"just like there are different types of people that might be more likely to show clinical disease, the same thing may be true with our animals,\" said dr. jason stull, a veterinary epidemiologist and assistant professor at the atlantic veterinary college at the university of p.e.i. \"we need more information. the fact that hong kong has started to do this, i think will be overall helpful and better [for] understanding what the true risk might be.\" should pets of covid-19 patients be isolated? weese said one scenario that needs to be ruled out are \"perfectly healthy\" animals that show no signs of infection but are still able to shed the virus. \"so even if they can\\'t get infected, we\\'re worried they could track it around,\" he said. \"that\\'s why i want to get the awareness out that if you have a dog, cat or ferret, and you\\'re isolating at home, those animals should be isolated at home with you.\" hong kong\\'s afcd says it \"strongly advises\" that dogs and cats from the homes of covid-19 patients be put under quarantine as a precaution, while the world health organization says it is monitoring the situation closely. \"we\\'re only aware of this one animal that\\'s tested positive and he\\'s doing well,\" dr. maria van kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist with the who, said at a news conference thursday. \"we don\\'t believe that this is a major driver of transmission … but again it\\'s only one example of this and so of course it deserves much more study.\" should canadian pet owners be concerned? the public health agency of canada says there is currently no evidence to suggest that any animal native to canada (wild, livestock or pets) harbours the virus that causes covid-19 and animals in canada don\\'t pose a risk of infecting people with the virus. the agency recommends that, until we know more, patients infected with covid-19 and have a pet or other animal should: avoid close contact with them; do not snuggle or kiss them, and do not let them lick you, sit on your lap or sleep in your bed. avoid coughing and sneezing on your pet or other animal. wash your hands before touching or feeding your pet or other animals. limit your pet\\'s or other animal\\'s contact with other people and animals. a man from orangeville is the first person to test positive for the coronavirus in the area covered by wellington-dufferin-guelph public health. the man, who is in his 40s, tested positive for covid-19 after returning from atlanta, ga. the man was tested at the headwaters health care centre in orangeville. dr. nicola mercer, medical officer of health and ceo of wellington-dufferin-guelph public health, said the case does not change how public health\\'s protocols around the coronavirus. \"we are following up with any contacts of the individual and ensuring the public is aware and protected from the spread of this virus. it is important to know that 80 percent of people with this virus will have mild to moderate symptoms,\" mercer said in a release. she encouraged anyone concerned about the virus to contact their health care provider or telehealth. in guelph, public health plans to open a covid-19 assessment clinic at 65 delhi st. on tuesday. the clinic will be open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily. on monday, the province announced 32 new cases of covid-19, bringing the total to 177. one of the heads of the london health sciences centre says he\\'s confident the hospital can cope with an influx of patients because of covid-19. but two union leaders say that might be too optimistic a take, pointing to janitorial ranks being constantly short-staffed and wait times in the hospital\\'s ers already topping more than 12 hours. a second positive case of covid-19 was confirmed saturday in london, a woman in her 50s who works in primary care but not in a hospital. she was tested for the virus at lhsc. \"we are absolutely not prepared. we already have admission wait times of up to 18 hours in the emergency department. can you imagine if we actually had a real case of covid-19 enter a very crowded emergency department, how quickly that would spread through that community of people?\" said peter bermanis, who represents personal support workers and some nurses for unifor local 27, and is the head of the london health coalition. \"this is a very serious situation in ontario. we already have the most overcrowded hospitals in the country and we are continuously cutting more and more beds.\" what\\'s closed in london: covid-19what you need to know now about the coronavirus: new method of diagnosing illness but london health sciences centre chief operating officer neil johnson said that while hospitals, including lhsc, are running at capacity, staff and doctors are ready. \"we\\'re certainly planning with the health unit, to make sure that screening is done elsewhere. we\\'re making plans to ensure that, if the numbers grow, we can respond to that,\" johnson said. janitorial staff shortage: union hospital rooms are being cleaned with an amped-up protocol, similar to one followed during the sars outbreak, said union head maria mcfadden, who represents about 400 janitorial staffers employed by sodexo, the company which lhsc has hired to clean victoria and university hospitals. staffers wear extra gloves and masks as well as full gowns, said mcfadden. people are told to wash their hands frequently.

toronto\\'s largest organizations, agencies and businesses stepped up their response as more covid-19 cases were confirmed across the gta in recent days. how some of toronto\\'s biggest organizations are handling the coronavirus 3 new coronavirus cases confirmed in toronto, bringing ontario total to 18 three new cases were confirmed in ontario on monday. all of them are people who had recently travelled to iran or egypt, or family members of those who had visited the countries. as a result, travellers arriving in canada from iran will now be asked to self-isolate for two weeks to prevent the spread of covid-19. travellers from iran asked to self-isolate for 14 days after arriving in canada chief public health officer dr. theresa tam said the new measure is being imposed because new cases confirmed in canada have been traced to travel in iran, a pattern she called \"very concerning.\" the overall canadian total is now 34 cases, said health officials. thirteen others in b.c. and one person quebec have tested positive for the virus. a canadian north flight to an oilsands mine sat for three hours on a remote northern alberta runway before returning to edmonton after it was discovered a crew member on an earlier flight had been in contact with a coronavirus patient. the plane was chartered to fly to cnrl\\'s horizon oilsands mine north of fort mcmurray, a passenger told cbc news in an exchange of text messages. the passenger, who feared losing their job for speaking out, was granted anonymity by cbc. the plane, carrying 130 employees, flew from edmonton tuesday to the fort mackay/horizon airport where it was grounded on arrival, the passenger said. the plane remained on the tarmac for almost three hours before a crew member addressed the cabin, the passenger said. a video obtained by cbc news shows a canadian north crew member speaking to passengers. cbc has altered the video to blur the face of the crew member due to privacy concerns. a video supplied to cbc shows a canadian north crew member addressing passengers aboard a flight that landed at fort mckay, alta. about a possible coronavirus contamination. cbc has decided not to identify the crew member due to privacy concerns. 2:19 in the video, the crew member apologizes for the wait before saying, \"supposedly, somebody was indirectly in contact with a presumptive coronavirus patient.\" the crew member also says he was told the risk to those on board was low, but alberta health, cnrl and canadian north management were discussing what to do. \"they didn\\'t want me to tell anybody anything and finally i said, \\'someone\\'s got to know something.\\' so this is me trying to put you at ease,\" the crew member says on the video \"there\\'s no … very low risk.\" a passenger, who can\\'t be seen on the video, asks: \"is there someone on here? or the virus is on the plane?\" the crew member says the infected person is a family member of someone who was on the plane during an earlier flight. \"it\\'s not anybody on board right now.\" the crew member also says alberta health deemed the risk low. \"they figure it\\'s so low-risk that when you get back to edmonton you\\'re free to go.\" he says officials are being cautious because cnrl horizon is a work camp. \\'cavalier and nonsensical\\' passengers were flown back to edmonton and told to monitor themselves for symptoms. the passenger said the entire event seemed \"cavalier and nonsensical\" because all of the \"potentially-infected workers\" were sent to the work site the next day. the passenger said when the plane returned to edmonton, \"nobody from alberta health met our plane and little information was shared about self-quarantine, etc.\" in an email wednesday, dan valin, manager of marketing and communications for canadian north, said, \"members of our senior executive team were made aware of a possible covid-19 connected situation.\" officials had been informed that a crew member reported being in close contact with someone who had later tested positive for coronavirus, valin said. \"the crew member was made aware of the person\\'s positive test result only after they had operated a flight for one of our alberta charter clients.\" valin did not specify which client he was referencing. canadian north contacted the public health authority and is following all recommendations, he said. the crew member is now in self-isolation. nobody from alberta health met our plane and little information was shared about self quarantine.- canadian north passenger \"the risk level has been assessed by the public health authority as very low for passengers and crew but we will err with an abundance of caution,\" valin said. the crew is now in self isolation, he said. cnrl is continuing operations as normal. tom mcmillan, spokesperson for alberta health, said the department can\\'t comment on the incident. westjet freezes hiring, discretionary spending as coronavirus curbs air travel

and waited to see if she would exhibit any signs of the deadly coronavirus. zhang spent more than two weeks visiting family in tianjin, china, returning in mid-february. although she didn\\'t feel sick, she didn\\'t need to think twice about going into quarantine. messages she received from her friends who also returned from trips abroad also contributed to her decision. \"they said it\\'s

she said. \"even i can\\'t just go to the school and meet my friends there.\" watch: joy zhang says after a few days, isolation gets lonely and you really want to talk to people: joy zhang said she didn\\'t feel sick or exhibit covid-19 symptoms. instead, the decision to self-quarantine was in part inspired by a desire to stay cautious. 1:41 though she was essentially alone, zhang said she was able to stay in touch with friends and family through the wechat social media application, as well video chat services like facetime. \"it felt quite stressful,\" she said. \"because i already stayed [inside] in china for about 15 days. then when i came back here, i [had] to stay 14 days more. in total, it\\'s around one month i just stayed at home.\" in addition to staying connected to friends and family, zhang said she was able to rely on assistance from members of windsor\\'s own chinese community who have spent the past several weeks volunteering their time by running errands for self-quarantined residents. \"i connected to, i think, one of their leaders, and then she sent me a message that if i need any other kind of help, she can send others to help me,\" zhang said. \"they just took their time to help us.\" joy zhang decided to self-quarantine for 14 days after returning from tianjin, china in february 2020. (jason viau/cbc) when she was finally able to once again interact with the outside world, zhang said one of the first things she did was let all of her friends know that they can \"come over to my house and then we can have dinner here.\" since stepping outside again, zhang hasn\\'t noticed any different treatment from strangers. as for advice for anyone considering self-quarantine, zhang said it\\'s best to avoid completely isolating one\\'s self. \"communicate with others and try to find help from others,\" she said. \"i know that the chinese community is very good to help you, and you can find help from others that share your emotions.\" there are currently no covid-19 cases in windsor-essex. health canada has logged 103 confirmed covid-19 cases across the country. there are 42

staff are back home,\" the statement says. \"this contamination, according to our investigation, is not related to travel, but originates from the community.\" the health agency\\'s director, dr. alain poirier, was in regular contact with several of the infected employees but is not showing symptoms, said spokesperson annie-andrée émond. she said he is still coming into work, but wearing a mask, keeping a safe distance from colleagues and handling interviews by telephone only. the health agency says, despite the recent positive cases, epidemiological investigations and other activities are continuing and that this situation will not lead to a break in service. radio-canada reported earlier in the week that three of the ciusss de l\\'estrie-chus employees who had tested positive were doctors. the agency has 20,000 employees and doctors, émond said. \"it was foreseeable that members of the organization would be infected and this situation worries us,\" she said. \"we strive to

unless it is absolutely necessary,\" the release stated. one day after premier scott moe pledged \"a higher degree of transparency\" in reporting covid-19 case data, the government has included more detail about positive cases. \"i talked with the minister of health this morning, specific to trying to be as transparent as possible with the information that we\\'re providing through the media to the people of the province,\" moe said on wednesday. he said information such as the age of positive covid-19 cases, general locations, hospitalizations and recoveries could be provided in more detail in the future. \"just be a little bit gracious with us,\" moe said. \"we are endeavouring to get to a level of a higher degree of transparency. we\\'re attempting to get there as soon as we can.\" the

(government of saskatchewan) information shared on early cases since the province began publicly reporting presumptive cases of covid-19 the level of detail provided has waned. the first case of covid-19 in saskatchewan was reported on march 12. dr. shahab told the public the case was a saskatoon man in his 60s who had recently returned from egypt. shahab said the man was self-isolating at home and had not come into contact with community members. saskatchewan\\'s covid-19 cases, as reported on march 17.

gerdts said with the money in hand, the lab can now begin testing the vaccine on animals and study the safety of the vaccine. he said once the vaccine has passed safety tests on animals, it will need to be studied in humans. researchers also hope to better understand issues like transmission between animals, impact of age on disease and susceptibility of agricultural animals like chickens or pigs. \"the goal is to develop a disease in these animals that is similar to humans, so that we then can use that as a read-out to show that our vaccine works, or it doesn\\'t,\" gerdts told cbc news. the 12-member team is led by darryl falzarano. he said the ultimate goal of the project is to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine that provides protection against multiple coronaviruses. finance minister bill morneau\\'s upcoming budget will include measures to deal with the immediate threat covid-19 presents to the canadian economy, while also focusing on the long-term need to transform the economy to adapt to climate change. in a speech on friday, morneau promised support would be coming next week for canadians who have to be quarantined to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and covid-19, the infectious respiratory disease caused by the virus. support coming for canadians quarantined due to coronavirus, finance minister says morneau also said he would include a larger-than-normal risk adjustment in his budget — essentially a contingency plan — to make sure canada has the fiscal firepower to respond to the virus-related slump hitting the global economy. \"we are continuing to monitor the impact on businesses and workers. we have the tools to respond quickly,\" said morneau. morneau also spoke of the need to position canada as a global leader in the fight against climate change, which he called \"the defining issue of our time.\" \"there is no path forward for canadian businesses that doesn\\'t include reducing their carbon emissions. investors just won\\'t be there,\" morneau said on friday. \"for the energy sector, we intend on working together on approaches that reduce emissions and create more economic opportunities for the workers and businesses, including in the prairies.\" a senior government official told cbc news this budget will make a start on answering a fundamental question: \"what does clean growth look like in canada?\" it will build on the message prime minister justin trudeau delivered recently to a mining conference about the need to find common ground on the path to reaching net-zero carbon emissions in 2050. trudeau says mining sector has a role to play in fighting climate change \"we\\'re not anti-oil. we\\'re not anti-steel. we\\'re anti-carbon,\" the senior official said. the budget\\'s climate measures are expected to focus on three main areas: meeting emissions targets, helping the fossil fuel sector transform itself, and offering support to workers displaced by that transformation. prime minister justin trudeau pushed the need to find common ground between climate change, the economy and indigenous communities at a mining conference in toronto. 1:51 but the official cautioned that the budget will only be a starting point; trudeau has said that consultations with industry and indigenous communities will start in earnest in april on how to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 without crippling resource industries. both of these issues will land on the first ministers\\' table next week, when the premiers come to ottawa to meet with trudeau. there will be political pressure on all levels of government to work together on a coordinated health and economic response to the covid-19 outbreak. but there also will be political tensions over the state of resource development in the country and outstanding provincial demands for larger cash transfers from the federal government. morneau says he\\'s open to fiscal stabilization reform - but provinces are pushing for health cash the premiers — led by alberta\\'s jason kenney — are demanding an overhaul of the fiscal stabilization program that would send billions to struggling oil-producing provinces like alberta, saskatchewan and newfoundland and labrador. mornreau agreed in december to review the program. so far, however, he hasn\\'t announced any changes to the program or sent any new money to the provinces. budget 2020: alberta continues plan to cut spending amid volatile economy since then, alberta has tabled a budget that projects a $6.8 billion deficit, while newfoundland and labrador premier dwight ball announced that he would resign later this year once the provincial liberal party chooses a successor. a senior newfoundland and labrador government source said the province\\'s fiscal position was a big factor in ball\\'s decision to step aside. the global commodity slump is hammering provincial revenues; the source said that ball, who leads a minority government, wasn\\'t convinced he had the political capital to win support for a bad-news budget. the government of newfoundland and labrador premier dwight ball is counting on federal adjustments to the fiscal stabilization program to help it get past a resource revenue slump. (cbc) a second newfoundland and labrador source said the provincial government won\\'t table its budget until after morneau tables his — and the province is counting on changes to the fiscal stabilization program. all of these factors will test morneau\\'s goal, expressed in his speech friday, to keep spending to \"practical and prudent\" levels. the finance minister admitted that the coronavirus\\'s economic impacts \"cannot be known, until they are known.\" speaking friday in montreal, economic development minister mélanie joly offered a sense of how the outbreak is hitting the canadian economy in ways large and small. \"chinese tourists have a $2 billion impact in canada and we expect that to go down by $550 million by june,\" joly said. \"to give you another example, the duty-free boutique at the vancouver airport is down 50 per cent of its revenue.\" ontario health officials are confirming 3 more cases of covid-19, on the same day they revealed another person has recovered from the illness. late on thursday, peel public health confirmed the first positive case of the coronavirus in peel region. the affected individual is a man in his 60s who is a resident of mississauga. the man was aboard the grand princess cruise ship out of san francisco from feb. 11 to 21. he returned to canada on feb. 28, health officials said in a statement. \"the individual was seen and assessed at trillium health partners-mississauga hospital, where all infection protection and control (ipac) protocol were followed,\" said dr. dante morra, chief of staff with trillium health partners. \"the individual is recovering at home and has been put on self-isolation.\" more than 1,500 people tested for covid-19 there are now 19 positive patients and four resolved cases, according to the provincial health ministry. provincial statistics show more than 1,500 people have been tested for the virus so far with 78 people currently under investigation. earlier today health officials reported two other cases — a woman in her 50s who returned to kitchener, ont., from italy and a man who returned to toronto from iran. timeline of covid-19 cases across canada the woman returned from a trip to italy on march 3 and presented herself to grand river hospital\\'s emergency department in kitchener. she was assessed, tested, and discharged home the same day. coronavirus case confirmed in waterloo region health officials say the patient is experiencing mild symptoms and remains in self-isolation at home with minimal contact with others. the provincial health ministry says the hospital followed standard operating procedures and continues taking necessary precautions. the region of waterloo public health says the agency is actively monitoring the situation, including contact tracing. the second new case stems from a man in his 60s who returned from iran on feb 29. travellers from iran asked to self-isolate for 14 days after arriving in canada health officials say he presented himself to sunnybrook health sciences centre\\'s emergency department in toronto on march 3. the man was also assessed and discharged home on the same day. he went into self-isolation where he remains with minimal contact with others. toronto public health says they are actively engaged in contact tracing and case management. the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in ontario is now 23. the overall canadian total is 38. stores in charlottetown are running low on hand sanitizer as people brace for the potential of coronavirus arriving in p.e.i. a-1 vacuum manager paul thomson says he started wednesday with 156 units of sanitizer, and he\\'s now sold out. \"people are looking for hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes … and unfortunately we are not able to get more to provide for people. so we have sold probably three months worth of product in the last three days,\" said thomson. \"it\\'s good in one way and not in the other. it\\'s good that we\\'ve generated a lot of sales, however we are now pretty much sold out of product.\" thomson said a-1\\'s customers are usually offices, businesses and banks. he said tuesday morning a customer tried to buy out his entire remaining stock of products, so he had to come up with a rationing policy. cbc news has observed low or non-existent stocks of hand sanitizer at stores across the city. p.e.i. preparing for possibility of local coronavirus cases, says morrisoncoronavirus outbreak projected to have impact on p.e.i.\\'s economic growth \\'gone for some days now\\' cbc news is also reporting similar shortages in st. john\\'s, ottawa and london, ont. thomson says a-1 is sold out of product. cbc news observed low or non-existent stock at many charlottetown stores.

trudeau next week in ottawa. cbc news has seen a draft agenda of friday\\'s meeting that shows the morning sessions will start with a \"discussion on coronavirus\" followed by a \"discussion on disruption to canada\\'s rail service\" due to recent indigenous-led protests. the first ministers are also expected to sit down with indigenous leaders on thursday for a planned two-hour discussion. multiple sources tell cbc news that canada\\'s chief public health officer dr. theresa tam is expected to brief the first ministers on the latest information about the virus\\'s spread in canada. multiple premiers offices tell cbc news that they want to focus the discussion on the real and lasting economic impacts of both the virus and the blockades. next friday\\'s agenda also includes sessions on the economy, climate and energy, health, infrastructure, fiscal stabilization and northern priorities — issues that were brought forward from the premiers\\' meeting last december in toronto. alberta premier jason kenney has been leading a push for the federal government to lift the cap on the fiscal stabilization program and provide retroactive payments to alberta. the program is intended to help provinces when they experience a sudden drop in revenues. kenney has requested $2.4 billion from the feds because his province has been weathering an economic crisis due to cratering oil prices. majority of canadians unhappy with trudeau\\'s handling of blockade crisis: pollfederal budget will focus on coronavirus response, climate change the agenda for friday\\'s meeting says there will be an update on the status of those discussions. ontario premier doug ford and the other provincial and territorial leaders will again call on the federal government to increase annual health care transfers to 5.2 per cent from the current three per cent. ford also has been pushing the federal liberals to commit funding to a $10.9 billion subway project in toronto. a source said that since the trudeau government was re-elected last october, ford has been friendly, collaborative and constructive with the trudeau government and has toned down the hyper-partisan rhetoric of the

as well as prepare for the possibility that \"hordes of people\" might be diagnosed with coronavirus. \"it\\'s just trying to get ready for what we\\'re going to be facing,\" he said. \"we are seeing

vehicle back to the interior. henry says she began experiencing symptoms upon her arrival and immediately isolated herself at home. vancouver coastal health and interior health are conducting investigations into the small group of people with whom she had contact. officials are still determining if people on the same flights as the patient need to be contacted, said henry. she said the woman wore a mask while in transit. henry says the woman reached out to health officials in the interior about her illness and was placed in isolation in hospital. the b.c. centre for disease control (bccdc) said a test for the virus came back positive thursday afternoon. that test must be confirmed by the national microbiology laboratory in winnipeg. the patient is in stable condition, and is now in isolation at home, said henry. those who are known to have come into contact with her are also in isolation at home. \"so once again we\\'re very thankful and grateful that the people who are coming back not just from hubei province but all over china are taking the advice very seriously to self-monitor and to connect with us and make sure that they can be tested, assessed and cared for

be concerned. \"if the general population is concerned, just think about the people that are working with these viruses all the time,\" he said. \"but they have learned to work with them, it\\'s very safe and there should be no problem.\" with the genetic material, researchers can build the virus\\' proteins in a lab. they can test what compounds could stop those proteins from activating and replicating the virus. and with that, they can start to develop potential antivirals and vaccines, which they would eventually test against the entire virus. \"i just wanted people in alberta to know that this institute is designed for this type of work. we have excellent virologists who are chomping at the bit to get this virus and begin their work.\" \\'around for quite a bit longer\\' the

human use, tyrrell said. \"at the end of the day, this is about trying to find, through cooperation around the world, the best and fastest way we can to control this epidemic so that people are safe

who were aboard have the illness. no additional countries are reporting cases. a new method of diagnosing the illness caused by novel coronavirus is allowing front-line medical workers in china to get patients into care more quickly and public health departments to then track down people who may have come into contact with the virus. at a world health organization news conference thursday, dr. mike ryan, executive director of who\\'s emergency program, explained an apparent spike in deaths and new cases reported by chinese authorities. china now has 59,805 confirmed cases, up 15,152 from wednesday, and the number of deaths increased by 254 to reach 1,367. the increase comes after many suspect cases from hubei province that had been backlogged were reclassified using patients\\' chest images, rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation, said ryan. so, the increase is largely due to a change in how cases are being diagnosed and reported, he said. a mother and toddler wear masks

(liam richards/the canadian press) \"we\\'re working as hard as we can to move this as fast as possible,\" she said. \"we have other vaccines in the pipeline in case this isn\\'t the best vaccine that we can put forth.\" there are now 68 cases of covid-19 in nova scotia, which has been under a state of emergency since sunday. halifax father-daughter duo researching \\'rapid response\\' tests, vaccines to combat covid-19 unlike a typical flu vaccine that\\'s created using protein from a virus, kelvin said the vaccine her team is testing uses a piece of the virus\\'s dna. \"and it uses your own cells to produce protein that will teach your immune system what the virus looks like,\" she said. kelvin said the dna vaccine was developed by her colleague, roy duncan, and is one of three types of vaccines the team is evaluating right now. how long will it take? kelvin said sars cov-2 is a good candidate for a vaccine because coronaviruses don\\'t mutate as quickly as the influenza virus does. the virus has a \"proofreading mechanism\" that allows it to correct any mistakes that are made to its dna when it replicates and infects a host, she said. \"which means that the virus and its proteins are a bit more stable so we can target it better.\" vido-intervac, the saskatoon-based lab where kelvin is working as a visiting professor, began researching a vaccine in january, and just received $23 million from the federal government to keep doing that work. but even with an influx of funding, and with scientists around the world working feverishly, vaccine development can be a long and complicated process. kelvin said she hopes to get an effective vaccine out to people by the time covid-19 returns. \"there\\'s a possibility that we could start seeing it causing seasonal infections and disease as we do with influenza virus. if this is the case, we\\'ll have this vaccine ready for when the virus comes back,\" kelvin said. in the meantime, stay home as researchers spend long days in the lab, nova scotians can help by following the advice public health officials have been saying from the beginning, kelvin said. stay home, and if you must go out, stay away from other

say your spouse passes coronavirus on to you after returning from a business trip abroad. is that considered community transmission? not necessarily — experts say the answer is a little more nuanced. on wednesday, manitoba\\'s chief public health officer, dr. brent roussin, announced 14 newly identified cases of covid-19 in the province, bringing the total lab-confirmed and probable cases in manitoba to 35. \"most of the new cases are connected to travel or through contact to previously announced cases,\" roussin said during one of the daily provincial covid-19 news conferences. some of the cases in that fresh wave involve people who contracted the virus without travelling themselves, yet roussin wouldn\\'t say just yet that manitoba is in the community-transmission stage of the spread. that\\'s because health officials can still trace these cases involving people who didn\\'t travel themselves back to a specific source, providing what roussin termed \"a known transmission chain.\" manitoba sees its largest 1-day jump in covid-19 cases, bringing total to 351st death, 3 new cases: what manitobans need to know about covid-19 the \"first-generation cluster\" was the chain of travellers who returned with the coronavirus, passing it to others who then also tested positive, explained dr. kelly macdonald, head of the infectious diseases program for the winnipeg regional health authority and a member of an operations committee advising the province on covid-19. \"it may be what we\\'re seeing is … all those people who were positive last week, now this is the second wave from their contacts,\" said macdonald, who is also a professor in the departments of medicine, microbiology and immunology at the university of manitoba. \"the fact that we can identify that those are part of a transmission cluster is a good sign.\" \\'pop-up\\' community transmissions it\\'s a good sign in contrast to \"pop-up\" cases, which is what roussin and macdonald say would be considered the truer and more worrisome sign that community transmission is occurring. right now, when someone tests positive in manitoba, health officials do an exhaustive review of their movements and people they came into contact with. so far, all cases in the province have been linked back to travel, or someone who travelled. but pop-up cases occur when health officials identify a positive case and still aren\\'t able to pinpoint where that person contracted the virus — even after an exhaustive review, said macdonald. when pop-up cases begin to grow, as they have in other jurisdictions, a trickle of cases — like manitoba is currently experiencing — can quickly develop into a flood, she said. the first place pop-up community transmission is likely to occur is in highly mobile people in the general population —those who already have illnesses and those who could have a big impact in spreading it, like health-care workers. macdonald points to some of the 11 alberta doctors and health-care workers who contracted covid-19 at the same group event earlier this month as something manitoba can avoid by testing its health-care workers. updated42 new cases of covid-19 reported in alberta, pushing total to 301 the alberta doctors continued to treat patients in the weeks that followed the event because they didn\\'t know they had the virus. \"that\\'s a really catastrophic thing,\" said macdonald. \"that\\'s why we\\'re doing surveillance in health-care [workers]. we want to look for populations who are high risk for getting it and we want to look for populations who are high risk for spreading it.\" a report out tuesday by the public health agency of canada suggests more than half of all canadian cases are considered community transmission in the pop-up sense. one of the main ways of staving off catastrophe is to prevent or delay pop-up community transmission through social distancing. that\\'s how you flatten the disease curve or keep it from ever taking shape, said macdonald. \"that\\'s why these disease curves start out kind of flat and then they suddenly go straight up, is because of that\" pop-up community transmission, she said. \"that\\'s why if nobody goes anywhere, you don\\'t get that straight up part of the curve — because nobody has a chance to interact.\" for 71-year-old george malky, ordering groceries online is not part of his regular routine — but it\\'s what many people are doing, as they change their lives to comply with the government\\'s plea that they stay home as much as possible. \"what choice do i have?\" asked malky, who lives in villeray. he plans to try his hand at online grocery shopping for the first time thursday. since the quebec government declared a public health emergency almost two weeks ago, grocery stores have been scrambling to adapt to tighter sanitary regulations, even as they strive to protect their own workers and they\\'re inundated by online grocery delivery requests. many of quebec\\'s supermarkets are operating at reduced hours, in order to give them more time to clean surfaces and stock shelves. but they\\'re open, near the top of the list of essential services — and in many cases, they\\'re going beyond the call of duty to help contain the spread of covid-19 and keep customers\\' bellies full. first covid-19 death in montreal brings quebec total fatalities to 7 iga george malky, 71, who lives in villeray, will try his hand at online grocery shopping for the first time on thursday. (submitted by george malky) the supermarket chain iga is offering free online and phone grocery delivery for seniors aged 70 and older and for people with reduced mobility. when making online delivery orders, customers are asked to specify that they are in one of those categories. those who don\\'t have access to the internet can call their local iga grocery. to locate the closest store near you, check here. the grocery chain says delivery times will be longer than usual due to the high volume of online orders, and some orders might be modified, based on the availability of certain products. in-store shoppers are asked not to touch food unless they\\'re planning to buy it and to pay by credit card or interac, if possible, to avoid cash changing hands. that\\'s on top of the now-ingrained rule to remain two metres away from other people. stores will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day. the iga extra famille in viau said it received 325 online delivery requests on tuesday — up from the usual 70 per week. for that store, it means wait times will be between 24 to 48 hours. on facebook, the viau grocer asked people to take orders and shop for loved ones who may not be able to go into stores themselves. it also recommends making orders of $150 or more, to limit the number of trips people make to the store. iga also set up this email address to take orders: metro the metro grocery chain says it won\\'t be able to make online deliveries until april, due to high demand, advising people only to turn to online delivery if they are under obligatory quarantine or over 70.

five new cases of covid-19 in the london region, according to the middlesex-london health unit (mlhu). one of the newly reported cases wednesday is a woman in her 80s who has been hospitalized, according to the province. public health officials believe she contracted the virus from being in close contact with someone else. the second case is a woman in her 70s who recently travelled to the philippines, and is now in self-isolation, health officials said. the mlhu has not provided information yet on the three other new cases in the london region. first case in oxford county health officials have also confirmed oxford county\\'s first case of covid-19. a man in his 30s tested positive for the virus after coming into contact with someone else outside the region, according to southwestern public health. the patient has since been released from woodstock hospital and is recovering at home in isolation, officials said. ontario\\'s covid-19 death total jumps to 13, with 100

and is self isolating, the county said in a media release. now the joint health unit for the two counties is following up on anyone who had close contact. \"this news may be unsettling, but it isn\\'t a shock,\" said mayor ken hewitt in a statement. \"like so many other communities, we\\'ve been preparing for this scenario.\" the county wouldn\\'t give any details about the person, including where they worked, \"in the interest of protecting patient privacy\" in the small community. the person was tested outside haldimand-norfolk. no haldimand residents have yet tested positive for covid-19, but the health unit is preparing for it. hewitt said people should follow directions from local and provincial authorities and practice social distancing, and avoid all non-essential trips in the community. meanwhile, the niagara region had its first covid-19 death monday. the 84-year-old man was a resident at ina grafton gage village in st. catharines. niagara has nine cases as of noon today. brant county has three cases, including a woman who works at a hospital in cambridge and a man in critical care. as of 10:30 a.m., ontario has 671 confirmed cases of coronavirus and nine deaths.

(hearts yqr/facebook) nova scotia\\'s chief medical officer of health is encouraging people to reach out if they need someone to talk to as the covid-19 pandemic stretches on and social isolation becomes a fact of daily life. these are challenging times and it\\'s natural to feel afraid, dr. robert strang told a briefing wednesday. \"the premier and i are fully aware of the imposition and the challenges of what [protocols] we\\'ve put in place and what it\\'s requiring people to do,\" he said. but there are things people can do to help them gain a sense of control, including washing their hands and following social-distancing requirements, said strang, because by doing those things people are protecting themselves and others. \"don\\'t be afraid to talk to each other about it,\" he said. \"be open about how you\\'re feeling. reach out for help.\" \\'reach out and talk to someone\\' strang said more supports for people will soon be posted on the province\\'s coronavirus website, and the mental health crisis line (1-888-429-8167) and kids help phone (1-800-668-6868) remain in service. \"no one should feel like they\\'re in this alone,\" said premier stephen mcneil. \"make sure that, if you\\'re isolated, that you reach out and talk to someone and vice versa — if you know someone that\\'s been isolated, reach out and talk to them.\" the province announced wednesday that 17 new cases of covid-19 have been identified, bringing the total to 68 confirmed cases as of march 25. the cases are travel-related or connected to cases that were previously reported. \"several of the new cases are connected to groups or families who have returned to nova scotia following travel outside of canada,\" said strang. \"none of these cases are from spread within the community.\" although they expect some community spread, strang said everything they\\'re doing is built around minimizing potential spread. the province is behind places with more advanced case numbers, such as british columbia, alberta and ontario, and so efforts now could have big benefits, said strang. \"if we stick with it for the next few weeks, we have the opportunity to really get out in front and stay out in front of this and minimize the spread and the impact in nova scotia,\" he said. \"it\\'s critically important that we keep doing what we\\'re doing. we have good systems in place, but it depends on all of us to do that.\" cases numbers not a surprise the 68 individuals with positive test results range in age from younger than 10 to mid-70s. cases have been identified in all parts of the province, said strang. one individual remains in hospital. two people have recovered and their cases are considered resolved. to date, the province has 2,772 negative tests to go along with the 68 confirmed cases. strang said the numbers are where public health officials anticipated they would be. \"we knew that we had large numbers of people travelling and would be coming back this week,\" he said. \"on average we\\'re seeing for each case, a little under two close contacts,\" he said. strang said that means people are mostly adhering to self-isolation requirements and many of the contacts they\\'re having are within their households, which minimizes the spread. after blood donations plummet during pandemic, donors answer the call — big timewhat you need to know about getting new prescriptions, refills anyone who has travelled outside nova scotia must self-isolate for 14 days. on tuesday, mcneil announced plans to boost the province\\'s 811 system with more staff and more phone lines. the system has been pushed to capacity, with some people reporting long waits trying to get through. the premier promised the system would be further enhanced in the coming days. the nova scotia health authority has identified the regional hospitals it would be using as sites for covid-19 in-patient treatment. they include the regional hospitals in antigonish, sydney, truro and yarmouth, along with the dartmouth general and halifax infirmary. the iwk health centre will also provide in-patient care for covid-19 cases requiring hospitalization. \\'people are getting the message\\' other measures recently instituted include checkpoints at the province\\'s land border with new brunswick and ferries that enter the province in north sydney and digby. mcneil said the reports he\\'s getting suggest those measures are working and people are getting the information they need about the requirement to self-isolate. a dedicated lane on highway 104 has been established for essential-service workers so they aren\\'t tied up, he said. \"we have seen a reduction in traffic,\" said mcneil. i think people are getting the message.\" 2020 north american indigenous games postponed in light of covid-19 concernsventilator operators look to boost numbers in wake of covid-19 strang said testing will now include all close contacts of confirmed cases, even if they aren\\'t showing symptoms, and anyone who is admitted to hospital with severe symptoms consistent with the virus. testing capacity in nova scotia has doubled to 400 per day. provincial officials have called on the public to practise social distancing at all times and stay home and within their neighbourhoods as much as possible to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. people are being encouraged to send only one person from a household to the grocery store or pharmacy and for people to offer help to neighbours for whom that might not be possible. anyone who has travelled outside nova scotia or has

(blair gable/reuters) dr. theresa tam, canada\\'s chief public health officer, warned last week that \"this virus is going to be with us for some time. it will not be eradicated from the world in months.\" \"we will need to be prepared for another wave, potentially.\" like hong kong, singapore and taiwan, canada will also experience its own second wave after seeing initial success containing the virus through the social distancing measures currently in place, bogoch believes. when we start to lift those measures in the months down the line, are we going to start to see a rebound of the virus? the answer is most certainly yes.- dr. isaac bogoch, toronto general hospital research institute \"when we start to lift those measures in the months down the line, are we going to start to see a rebound of the virus? the answer is most certainly yes. we probably will see, to some extent, a greater number of cases as people mingle again as life slowly returns to normal.\" lifting social distancing measures slowly several modelling studies have been conducted to explore how effective social distancing is at dampening disease spread, said bogoch, and almost all show that when the reins are eventually loosened, cases will tick up again. but he said there are steps we can take to minimize the extent of a second wave. \"the hope is that we can slowly lift these measures, rather than have them completely lifted, and we can control the rebound of the virus such that it does not cause a situation where we overwhelm our health-care system and negate everything that we\\'ve done for the past few months.\" the key will be to change social distancing policies \"very slowly and carefully,\" he said. eleanor fish, a professor of immunology at the university of toronto whose research group conducted treatment studies during the 2003 outbreak of sars in toronto, said a true second wave of an outbreak involves new community transmissions, not just sick returning travellers who are swiftly moved into quarantine. vehicles of \\'snowbirds\\' and other canadians return at the u.s.-canada border crossing at the thousand islands bridge in lansdowne, ont., after it was announced the border would close to non-essential traffic to combat the spread. allowing canadians to return home right away should make a difference in the scale of any second wave, said eleanor fish, a professor of immunology at the university of toronto. (alex filipe/reuters) she said countries like china, where new cases are also travel-related, could face a second round of the outbreak but are \"nowhere near\" that territory yet. \\'we haven\\'t locked down our borders\\' fish also said she believes a second wave is \"unlikely to happen here.\" \"we haven\\'t locked down our borders to canadians. so any of those who might want to return, are returning. we\\'re asking them to self-isolate for 14 days.\" that means canada is less likely than other countries who shut their borders to citizens to have cases shoot up again upon their return. fish said she\\'s optimistic that the government is listening to the scientific community and learning from places, like italy, by preparing for a surge of severe cases by doing things like securing more ventilators. she also said she was buoyed by progress of research groups testing various forms of treatment. \"the public needs to be reassured that there\\'s a lot coming up that\\'s going to be very positive.\" jason kindrachuk, an assistant professor at the university of manitoba\\'s department of medical microbiology, said that during the 1918 spanish flu pandemic, there was both a second wave and a small third wave of the outbreak. improving supply of equipment, testing materials but he said canada can prepare now for a second wave of covid-19 illnesses in a number of different ways. it can improve the supply of personal protective equipment for front-line health-care workers, as well as the materials needed for testing, both of which have already been a challenge in the first phase of the epidemic, said kindrachuk, who holds a canada research chair in emerging viruses. a sign urges people to practise social distancing and keep 1.5 metres apart, in the vondelpark in the centre of amsterdam on march 21. (peter dejong/the associated press) and although little is known yet about the seasonality of the virus and how much immunity people will have after recovering from the illness, canada can look to the nations that are months ahead of it in the progression of the pandemic. we can learn from what those countries do in terms of when they start reducing the requirements for social distancing to help guide our own procedures and time frame for doing that so we don\\'t see spikes in increased transmission.- jason kindrachuk, university of manitoba\\'s department of medical microbiology \"we can learn from what those countries do in terms of when they start reducing the requirements for social distancing to help guide our own procedures and time frame for doing that so we don\\'t see spikes in increased transmission.\" the true long-term strategy, said bogoch, is the creation of an effective vaccination, \"which we know is more than a year away.\" \"but for now, we just have to put up with the physical distancing measures.\" a quebec medical research team has begun recruiting quebecers over the age of 40 who test positive for the novel coronavirus to study whether a powerful drug already approved for other uses could help treat covid-19. researchers at the montreal heart institute have been working day and night to launch the clinical study, named colcorona, to find out if colchicine is effective in treating complications of covid-19. colchicine is an orally administered anti-inflammatory drug used to treat gout, behçet\\'s disease and familial mediterranean fever. \"colchicine is an old drug,\" said dr. jean-claude tardif, the institute\\'s director of the research, in an interview with cbc montreal\\'s daybreak. \"it\\'s inexpensive; it\\'s widely available, and the reason why we think it might very well work is that it\\'s a powerful anti-inflammatory agent.\" quebec halts everything but essential services as community transmission of covid-19 detected the research director at the montreal heart institute, cardiologist jean-claude tardif, said if researchers can prove the effectiveness of colchicine in treating covid-19\\'s respiratory complications early, quarantining people might no longer be necessary. (montreal heart institute) tardif, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at université de montréal, says the drug could mitigate the lung inflammation which leaves many covid-19 patients struggling to breathe. that can escalate into an \"\\'inflammatory storm\" which can in turn lead to death. \"we are launching the study today because every minute, every hour counts,\" tardif said. \"we want to deliver the results to the population and the health care system rapidly.\" about 125 people from various health organizations — including the centre hospitalier de l\\'université laval in quebec city, health canada and the montreal-based firm pharmascience — worked feverishly to mount the study in six days. typically, tardif said, such an endeavour would take six to nine months. researchers hope to recruit 6,000 candidates from quebec over the age of 40 who test positive for the novel coronavirus but are not in hospital. half of those patients will receive colchicine, while the other half will receive a placebo. \"this is not about anecdotes or random observations,\" tardif said. \"this is about delivering a robust answer for the world.\" quebecers who meet the criteria and wish to take part in the study can find out more from their doctor or by calling 1-877-536-6837 (montreal heart institute) successful treatment could transform crisis, says tardif medical research teams in quebec and around the world have begun clinical testing of proposed vaccines to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but most experts say it could still be 12 to 18 months before a vaccine is approved. effective treatment of the severe complications of covid-19 \"would completely transform, instantaneously, what\\'s happening,\" tardif said. \"we need to do the study, prove that it works and then give the guidance to the government and health care system,\" tardif said. if researchers can prove the effectiveness of colchicine in treating the disease\\'s respiratory complications before patients need ventilators or they die, tardif says quarantining people might no longer be necessary. quebec gives $7m to medicago for vaccine testing quebec city-based medicago has received $7 million in provincial funding to start the first phase of testing of its covid-19 vaccine candidate developed in early march. (medicago) the clinical study is one of several quebec-based initiatives to combat the spread of the coronavirus. medicago, the quebec city biotech firm that developed a potential covid-19 vaccine in mid-march, has received $7 million in funding from investissement québec, the quebec government\\'s investment arm. quebec biotech firm produces a potential covid-19 vaccine the funds will \"will allow us to quickly start the first phase of testing of our covid-19 vaccine candidate before initiating clinical trials in humans this summer,\" said dr. bruce d. clark, medicago\\'s president and ceo. medicago\\'s project is also among several that will share $192 million in federal funding under a strategic innovation fund covid-19 stream announced monday. medicago was able to develop the vaccine candidate just 20 days after receiving the genetic sequence of the virus. the company uses plants to manufacture vaccines, which allows it to scale up production rapidly — in 2012 it was able to produce 10 million doses of an influenza vaccine for the u.s. defence department. stephen crosbie and his family feel \"extremely lucky\" to be back home in hamilton after nearly 10 days of uncertainty amid a covid-19 lockdown in peru. several hours prior to crosbie\\'s return, gordon morrow and his wife also made it home after being stuck in spain. these hamilton residents are only a handful of more than one million canadians who returned back home in the last week after being stranded abroad. more are on their way as airlines continue to pick-up citizens whose travel plans got derailed due to covid-19. on wednesday, the federal government said that all travellers returning to the country, aside from those considered \"essential workers,\" will enter a mandatory 14-day quarantine period. \"it was a tremendous relief,\" crosbie said of the moment he sat on the plane with his family. \"as the plane went down the runway and the wheels left the ground, it may have been me, but a round of applause was started and was joined in by everybody on the plane. everybody was just so glad to be going home.\" crosbie\\'s wife, catherine sellens, is an emergency department physician at hamilton health sciences. crosbie said sellens will remain in self-quarantine for the next two weeks before returning to work. though the trip home was not an easy one, crosbie said they\\'re just glad to be back. hamilton farmers\\' market vendors choose between health and income due to covid-1980-year-old nursing home resident is hamilton\\'s first covid-19 death due to covid-19, air canada had rescheduled the family\\'s departure flight from peru to april 3 — 12 days after their original return flight. crosbie, sellens, and their kids sarah, 17, and john, 14, left toronto on march 11 to visit machu picchu — though they never actually made it to the popular tourist location. as of march 16, they were in isolation at a hotel in lima. the family was fearful that the april 3 flight wouldn\\'t take place and made endless calls to the canadian government and air canada for earlier flights. \"it was a very stressful time... it\\'s the not knowing and not having any control over your own situation,\" crosbie said. on saturday, crosbie said the family received an email from the canadian embassy that air canada was sending a flight to lima tuesday.

an investigation has determined that 11 of 47 alberta health-care workers, most of them doctors, who attended an edmonton curling bonspiel earlier this month have now tested positive for coronavirus. some doctors who participated in the curling event from march 11 to march 14 treated patients early last week, before health officials learned about the first illness related to the bonspiel, the province\\'s chief medical officer of health said monday at a news conference. testing was later conducted on the participants and all 47 health-care workers who attended the bonspiel are self-isolating, dr deena hinshaw said. the province reported 42 new cases of covid-19 on monday, bringing the total in the province to 301. of the 301 cases, the majority are located in the calgary zone. the total cases by region: calgary zone: 188 edmonton zone: 68 north zone: 19 central zone: 17 south zone: 8 unknown: 1 about two dozen cases are thought to have been transmitted within the province, hinshaw said. eighteen people have been hospitalized, with seven of them in intensive care beds. alberta has been fighting a war on two fronts to slow the spread of the virus, hinshaw said, and over the coming days public health officials will be closely watching those community transmission numbers. \"that is our biggest concern,\" she said. \"i think we\\'ve dealt with, again, the one front of returning travellers with the measures we\\'ve put in place, and we need to make sure that those are being followed. and now the second front is where we need to focus our attention with community transmission.\" tests to detect the spread of the virus within the province will help officials understand whether current social distancing measures are sufficient, she said. but that understanding won\\'t come over the next few days but over the next few weeks. the goal is to slow the spread so there isn\\'t a steep peak in the number of cases, where many people end up needing hospital care at the same time. the latest on the covid-19 pandemic from edmonton, calgary and saskatchewan 15:27 testing changes hinshaw outlined changes to testing measures, which will now give priority to people who are most at risk of developing extreme symptoms or infecting others in the community. that includes people who are hospitalized with respiratory illness, residents of continuing care and other similar facilities, and people who returned from travelling abroad between march 8 and march 12, before the self-isolation protocols were in place. anyone with symptoms who doesn\\'t fit into any of these categories should stay home and self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days from the start of their symptoms, or until their symptoms resolve, whichever is longer. however, all returning travellers should follow self-isolation guidelines and monitor symptoms for 14 days. they should also check recent domestic and international flights for confirmed cases. later this week, health-care workers will be added to the list of people given priority for testing, hinshaw said, so those who test negative can \"return to the front lines\" as soon as possible. \"in an ideal world, we would be able to test albertans who have symptoms of cough, fever and even mild symptoms,\" hinshaw said. \"it\\'s unlikely we will be able to reach that kind of testing capacity to be able to test all albertans even with mild symptoms.\" rather than get tested, she said, people with mild symptoms should stay home and self-isolate. she also announced a new process will also be added to try to control the spread of the virus within hospitals. under the new policy, staff, doctors and contractors at health-care facilities will be met at the door and screened with temperature checks and a short questionnaire to assess health risk. anyone deemed not fit to work will be told to return home and self-isolate, hinshaw said. both ontario and quebec have ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses. hinshaw said alberta is slightly behind those provinces in terms of the spread of the virus, so that measure hasn\\'t yet been deemed necessary here. since the incubation period for the virus is 14 days it will take at least that long to learn if testing protocols and social distancing measures are working, she said. \"the measures we\\'re putting into place don\\'t make the virus go away, they just slow down the spread,\" hinshaw said. \"we only have so much testing capacity. the second front in the war that we\\'re fighting is the potential spread in our communities. \"as of today, we have over 20 cases we believe have been acquired in our community. and we need to do more testing to understand what that spread is like. and health-care workers provide both an opportunity to understand that spread as well as making sure that we\\'re helping those who are at greatest risk of being exposed.\" hinshaw highlighted that with warmer weather coming, albertans need to be mindful to maintain social distancing when outdoors, but said maintaining connections with each other is important for mental wellbeing. \"we are all in this together,\" she said. \"now more than ever, we need to take care of each other. this means now more than ever keeping up physical distance and now more than ever finding creative ways to maintain our bonds and stay socially connected.\" hinshaw announced that a new text message subscription has been launched to send messages of encouragement during the covid-19 pandemic. albertans can text covid19hope to 393939

mealtimes including staggered seating and ensuring residents are at least six feet apart. they\\'ve also been told they can\\'t congregate or touch each other. \"most seniors are immune-compromised in some way because of age, medication or just general condition, and we have to do our level best to protect them at all costs,\" terlson said. he admitted they\\'ve had some pushback from some of the residents\\' families. \"some of our family members, 95 per cent understand. but you get the individuals that want to take mom out of a safe environment, take them home for dinner, exposing them to grandchildren and various other things,\" terlson said. \"we can\\'t stop them, but if you take your loved one out of the facility, they\\'ll have to self-quarantine for 14 days coming back into the

alberta health services\\' vice-president and medical director for northern alberta, said on wednesday that most albertans who acquire covid-19 will be treated in place. \"they\\'ll stay home, they\\'ll stay in their usual place of residence, and the same thing would hold true for those in long-term care facilities or continuing care facilities,\" joffe said. he said it would be up to staff and physicians who supervise care at the facility to determine whether they think an individual would benefit from a transfer to hospital. ahs has not issued any direction not to transfer patients to hospital, joffe said. \"remember that there is no specific treatment for covid-19, so there is no specific therapy that would be offered if an individual arrives at hospital,\" joffe said. \"what we

(robyn miller/cbc ) but not all parents can make that juggling act work, according to carolyn fern, public policy co-ordinator with the ontario coalition for better child care. \"in a case where you have a single-parent family or [where] both parents are front-line workers, then [daycare] can be a really important service for those families,\" fern said. \"we\\'ve certainly been hearing from parents who\\'ve been reaching out to us that this service is so important.\" different provinces, different protocols the province of quebec launched daycare facilities for essential workers early on in the pandemic. in saskatchewan, child care was set up in schools to provide care to children of hospital employees and other front-line workers. ballantyne said she\\'s concerned by the fact that every province is making different decisions and implementing different protocols. her organization is calling on dr. theresa tam, canada\\'s chief public health officer, to set guidelines. \"right now we\\'re hearing a lot of different contradictory things coming out of different provinces and some public health authorities locally and provincially,\" said ballantyne. \"we\\'re not getting a sense of clear guidelines … we don\\'t really understand what kind of screening is going to be put in place. we don\\'t know what kind of ratios are going to be imposed.\" the province of ontario has said the daycare centres for essential workers should re-open by the end of the week. childcare advocate calls for national protocols, guidelines for emergency centres. 8:04 as news around covid-19 continues to evolve at a rapid fire pace and and uncertainty looms over seemingly everything, it\\'s easy to feel overwhelmed. canadians are being urged to practice social distancing by staying home as much as possible and maintaining two metres of distance between each other when going outside for exercise or to pick up groceries. but the need to stay physically apart doesn\\'t mean there\\'s nothing you can do to help out and combat that sense of helplessness. here are some six things you can do to support family, friends and strangers: 1. join an online forum a number of online forums have sprung up to crowdsource finding volunteers, resources and expertise. vancovid is a site created by a group of data scientists and software developers that allows people to sign up for volunteer services like dropping off groceries, driving people to appointments and more. the facebook group covid-19 coming together (vancouver) also allows people to ask questions, post their needs and offer up support. only buy the groceries you need and sign up for a volunteer service to drop off groceries to vulnerable people.

trying to determine his next moves on wednesday, after joe biden swept to victory in florida, illinois and arizona and seized a commanding lead in a democratic presidential race upended by the coronavirus. the vermont senator\\'s campaign manager, faiz shakir, said sanders \"is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.\" but shakir also suggested his candidate is no hurry to make any decisions about dropping out, noting that \"the next primary contest is at least three weeks away.\" more immediately, sanders \"is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,\" shakir said in a statement. even if sanders ultimately decides to keep running, however, he has little hope of catching biden — especially in a political world turned as upside down as much of the rest of society amid efforts to combat the spreading virus, which has killed at least 115 people in the united states. neither candidate is travelling or holding campaign rallies, and much of the electorate has been staying home. indeed, biden\\'s third big night in as many weeks on tuesday came amid tremendous uncertainty about how an already severely disrupted democratic primary will proceed. with 3 more victories, biden pulls further away from sanders polls were shuttered in ohio, and election workers and voters reported problems in the three states where primaries went forward, all of which biden easily won. the former vice-president now seems on a glide path to the nomination, his delegate lead over sanders nearly insurmountable. top democratic leaders and donors have also increasingly lined up behind biden as the best option to square off against president donald trump in november. using a livestream to address supporters from his home state of delaware, biden seemed ready to move past the primary. he paid tribute to the vermont senator for advancing key issues including affordable health care and combating climate change. watch: joe biden discusses leadership amid the coronavirus pandemic: former vice-president joe biden talks about how the coronavirus pandemic requires leadership and how americans\\' choices will make a big difference to the outcome. 1:09 \"sen. sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country,\" biden said. \"so let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by sen. sanders, i hear you. i know what\\'s at stake. i know what we have to do.\" with the exception of north dakota and the northern mariana islands, sanders hasn\\'t scored a victory since super tuesday on march 3. he made no moves to contact biden immediately after tuesday\\'s results, according to people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the candidates. during online remarks before most results were in, sanders said little about the future of the race. also tuesday, trump formally clinched the republican presidential nomination after facing minimal opposition. but much of the action was on the democratic side, where higher vote totals in some key states suggested enthusiasm that even the coronavirus couldn\\'t contain. turnout in florida\\'s democratic primary surpassed the 1.7 million who cast ballots four years ago. some democrats are now calling on sanders to drop out in the name of party unity, but sanders\\'s advisers have suggested he won\\'t rush to do so, betting that the political landscape could look different as the virus continues to reshape life across the country. four years ago, sanders kept an insurgent primary bid against hillary clinton going for months, even as it became clear he had no chance of winning. biden, meanwhile, maintained strength in the latest three states to vote with african americans and older voters, who have been the hallmark of his campaign. he also appeared to chip away at sanders\\'s previous advantage with hispanics that helped him win nevada and california early in the race. in florida, latinos made up roughly 20 per cent of democratic primary voters, and they largely sided with biden. the former vice-president received the support of 62 per cent of puerto rican voters and 57 per cent of cubans, according to ap votecast, a broad survey of primary voters. disruptions due to coronavirus still, going forward, the primary will be disrupted by the public health and economic havoc wreaked by the coronavirus. for most people, the novel coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. the vast majority of people recover from the virus. democratic national committee chairman tom perez blasted ohio for closing polls on such short notice, sparking confusion. but he also urged states with upcoming primaries to expand vote-by-mail and absentee balloting, as well as polling station hours — trying to ensure the primary continues, at least in some form. \"the right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,\" perez said in a statement. to date, alberta has completed just over 20,000 covid-19 tests — more than any other province in canada. that\\'s been possible due to existing infrastructure, the early availability of testing kits, collaboration with universities and a testing process that runs around the clock, according to alberta\\'s chief medical officer of health, dr. deena hinshaw. \"one of the advantages we have in alberta is our provincial lab for public health, which is in the alberta precision laboratories,\" hinshaw said during a facebook live appearance broadcast this week. \"they have an amazing setup and they work very hard to have cutting edge technology that enables us to respond quickly.\" the same lab was able to do local testing for ebola during the outbreak in west africa, she noted, and it had a leg up when the novel coronavirus that causes covid-19 began spreading globally. \"when this outbreak started in china and testing became available in canada, our lab was one that got the testing kits from the national lab and built some local capacity,\" hinshaw said. \"and then, they have really just reached out to colleagues locally. they\\'ve worked with universities ... and one of things they\\'re doing is they\\'re running their testing 24/7.\" alberta chief medical officer of health dr. deena hinshaw updates media on the covid-19 situation in the province during a briefing in edmonton on friday, march 20. (jason franson/the canadian press) to make that happen, hinshaw said health officials had to expand their roster of trained people capable of performing the tests, to ensure a steady stream of staff. \"so they have people who they\\'ve cross-trained to come in, so their equipment doesn\\'t sit idle,\" she said. \"i just can\\'t say enough about the work of the lab and how amazing they\\'ve been.\" testing capacities have been ramping up, as well. on tuesday, alberta performed more than 2,000 tests for the first time in a single day. on wednesday, just over 2,900 were completed and then another 2,800 on thursday. test volumes are also growing across the country. dr. theresa tam, canada\\'s chief public health officer, said on friday that 10,000 tests had been completed nationwide in the 24 hours since thursday, alone. a growing chorus of global experts are calling on countries around the world to test more frequently for covid-19, including among people not showing symptoms, as a way to monitor and combat the pandemic. thirteen toronto health-care workers have tested positive for covid-19, toronto public health confirmed to cbc news on sunday, as the city reports its first death related to a novel coronavirus outbreak. \"at this time there have been approximately 13 healthcare workers who have tested positive for covid-19,\" dr. michael finkelstein, acting director,

hospital in toronto and immediately began self-isolation at home. he was reported to toronto public health by the hospital and a case investigation was completed. the man later presented at the

scientist\" vancouverite jacques martiquet heard people were staying at home to ward off potential coronavirus infections, he knew it was time to act. martiquet, 24, operates vyve, a company hired to liven up meetings and events for corporations and festivals. they encourage people to dance, join conga lines and sing along to songs like eye of the tiger, all in the spirit of fostering human connection. which is exactly what he planned to do friday night — but this time for a group of a few hundred revellers joining in online from their homes. \"it\\'s more important than ever to maintain our mental health to stay connected to our communities and still have fun and experience joy,\" martiquet said. \"the virtual dance party is an opportunity for people to dance off all their stress, take care of their mental health and feel connected to people over the virtual world.\" martiquet is one of many people in british columbia and around the world organizing opportunities for people to gather and connect while maintaining social distancing measures to prevent the spread of covid-19. much of this activity is taking place online, with digital tools like zoom, facetime and skype replacing bars, concert halls and living rooms. #quarantineandchill: binge-worthy shows, podcasts and movies to keep you occupied lara aknin, an associate professor of psychology at simon fraser university, says the loneliness that self-isolation can cause means it\\'s more important than ever to find ways to socialize while maintaining a physical distance. \"all this great effort that people are investing into staying connected ... underscores the importance of human connection for our well-being,\" aknin said. aknin herself recently attended a virtual wine club meeting, where members who usually clink glasses did so virtually instead. in fact, virtual happy hour seemed to be one of the more popular activities to gather online, as are virtual dinner parties. <a

covid-19 measures were put in place it has moved practices online. (ian bryce) but finding a way for everyone to join in as a chorus is proving to be difficult. bryce says he\\'s still fishing for the right online platform to do so, especially given that his singers learn songs by artists like radiohead and arcade fire by ear rather than reading music. choir! choir! choir! hosts a social distance singalong amidst the covid-19 pandemic \"it\\'ll be a little bit more challenging because we won\\'t have any immediate feedback of people singing to us,\" he said. other people have planned more passive ways to spend time together online, like watching a movie or tv show together via streaming services like netflix party. arts performances go online for those interested in arts and entertainment, musicians and performing arts organizations have been streaming performances live online. vancouver-based music dan mangan announced he\\'ll be playing #quarantunes via the side door app every saturday, with donations going to a different charity each week. this week, theatre venue the cultch is livestreaming performances of mine, its most recent show cancelled due to the pandemic. the vancouver art gallery, which closed its doors earlier this week, says it plans to make some of its programming available online as well. unique lessons and experiences by artists and organizations are being offered online right now — for free if you have a covid-19-related story we should pursue that affects british columbians, please email us at impact@cbc.ca. until a few weeks ago, girl guides across b.c. were gearing up for one of their biggest annual fundraisers: selling boxes of their classic chocolate and vanilla cookies. then the covid-19 pandemic took hold — and now the organization is sorting out new ways to sell 800,000 boxes of the sweet treats. this year\\'s batch of cookies was baked, packaged and delivered to 18,000 girl guide members across b.c. before stay-at-home and social-distancing orders took effect, cutting off their ability to sell the treats at schools, workplaces, stores and other usual locales. so, the organization is calling on all cookie lovers to step up and do their part by pre-ordering or donating boxes to food banks or workers on the frontline of the pandemic. the spring cookie sale raises $4 million annually, with nearly two-thirds of the funds going directly to girl guides in b.c. \"those cookies power everything that we do as an organization. every science experiment, every craft, every sleepover, every camp,\" said diamond isinger, provincial commissioner for british columbia with the girl guides of canada. \"unfortunately, though, those deliveries coincided this year with covid-19 growing as a major concern just a week or two after those deliveries were made, leaving us with a lot of cookies on our hands that we\\'re figuring out how we can best sell in the safest and most logistically feasible way.\" the spring cookie sale raises $4 million annually, with nearly two-thirds of the funds going directly to girl guides in b.c. (girl guides of canada) according to a statement, people can contact a girl guide in their neighbourhood or through friends to pre-order cookies for when sales resume or ask to donate them to a food bank, to frontline health-care workers or to other essential service employees. business owners providing essential services can buy cases and give them out to customers. virtual dance parties, happy hours spring up to fight against loneliness during covid-19with events cancelled, quarantined curling tour gives players a virtual way to keep game alive people heading to canadian tire to pick up essential goods can also pick up a box or two — or entire cases — to sweeten their days stuck at home. the cookies have been sold in canada since 1927 and have traditionally funded activities like hiking and camping. in recent years, the girl guides has expanded its scope to include international travel, advocacy, scholarship opportunities, art workshops, financial literacy, science events, mental heath awareness and more. girl guides still go camping and hike, but in recent years the group\\'s initiatives have grown to include international travel, advocacy, scholarship opportunities, art workshops, financial literacy, science events and more.

(matt rourke / associated press) sanders\\' path to the nomination is quickly narrowing, and some democrats are now calling on him to drop out in the name of party unity. top advisers have said he\\'s considering whether the political landscape could look different as the virus continues to reshape life across the country, though. still, the race increasingly favours biden. he maintained the strength on tuesday with african americans and older voters who have been the hallmark of his campaign. he also appeared to chip away at sanders\\'s previous advantage with hispanics that helped him win nevada and california early in the race. in florida, latinos were roughly 20 per cent of democratic primary voters, and they largely sided with biden. the former vice president received the support of 65 per cent of puerto rican voters and 56 per cent of cubans, according to ap votecast, a broad survey of primary voters. the coronavirus effect still, the public health and economic havoc wreaked by the coronavirus will influence how the presidential contest unfolds. rallies and other big events have been cancelled. democratic national committee chairman tom perez urged states with upcoming primaries to expand vote-by-mail and absentee balloting, as well as polling station hours — trying to ensure the primary isn\\'t further hampered going forward. \"the right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,\" perez said in a statement. but the damage may have already happened. four states — louisiana, georgia, kentucky and maryland — have joined ohio in moving to push back their upcoming primaries, and others may yet do so. that has left the democratic primary calendar empty until march 29, when puerto rico is scheduled to go to the polls. but island leaders are working to reschedule balloting there, too. that means there is nowhere for sanders to gain ground on biden anytime soon, even if he could find a way to mount a sudden surge to recover. the city of windsor wants emergency support workers battling the covid-19 pandemic to know

conversation with the ministry ... to provide a little bit more guidance with respect to border travel.\" the number of detected cases in michigan is more than 780 and five deaths have been reported, some in the detroit area. ahmed said it is critical for healthcare workers on both sides of the border to be monitoring their symptoms. \"they should be connecting with their employers to see what their policies and procedures are following up if they are serving a person or if they are coming in contact with a confirmed case,\" ahmed said. \"we really expect that our health care workers would make a good judgment in terms of reporting to work and if they are sick, staying home and not infecting other individuals.\" to prevent the spread of covid-19, wechu recommends: wash your hands with soap and water thoroughly and often. cough and sneeze into a tissue or sleeve, and wash your hands. keep surfaces clean and disinfected. stay home when you are sick. avoid touching your eyes, nose and

ontario, which is now reporting more than 40 cases of covid-19, reported its first coronavirus case on jan. 25. five people in kahnawake, que., have been diagnosed with covid-19 including a person working at the hospital, the mohawk community\\'s hospital centre has announced. \"we haven\\'t been able to identify the source. therefore, that is a sign of community transmission,\" said lisa westaway, executive director of the kateri memorial hospital centre, at tuesday\\'s daily briefing by the community\\'s covid-19 task force. \"what that tells us, there are many people who are covid-19 positive and that we should all be taking precautionary measures,\" said westaway, at the briefing that was live streamed over facebook. the task force did not reveal the position held by the member of the hospital community found with the coronavirus. the new cases are unrelated to a case announced last week where a non-resident physician, who works at the hospital, tested positive for the virus after returning from new york, health officials said. quebec\\'s public health department told cbc news there is currently no data available on how many confirmed or presumed cases are in first nations or inuit communities in the province. but this week\\'s news doesn\\'t come as a surprise to kahnawake\\'s task force. \"this is not unexpected. we don\\'t give up. we\\'re ready for this,\" said westaway. \"this is a virus that is easily transmissible. it is across the world that is definitely going to be here no matter what we do.\" the mohawk community is located just south of montreal in the province\\'s montérégie region where there were 125 confirmed cases as of tuesday. the task force also stated that seven kahnawake mohawk peacekeepers are currently in self-isolation with no symptoms. officials did not explain why but people are required to self-isolate if they\\'ve travelled outside the province or have come in contact with someone who tested positive. supplies like personal protective equipment for its essential service workers are being stretched. like the province, kahnawake ordered all non-essential businesses in its territory to close. that includes cigarette shops to limit the number of non-residents coming and going. westaway said since the announcement was made monday about positive cases in the community, she\\'s seen a lot of shaming and blaming on social media. \"there is no one responsible, there is no one to blame. we only have the control of our individual selves to help stop transmitting as much as possible,\" she said. \"if we start going down the road of blame and negativity, it\\'s going to be very difficult to focus our energy on where it should be, which is in working with each other.\" westaway said it\\'s important

(cbc news) if you\\'ve been to the stores where alcohol wipes are in short supply, macnamara said you can also use household bleach. make sure to read the instructions and check the expiration date, but you can likely make a solution with a third of a cup of bleach mixed with about four litres of water. the active ingredient in bleach degrades, so make small batches and use diluted bleach solution within 24 hours. if none of that is an option, use soap and hot water. videop.e.i. confirms 3rd case of covid-19islanders: what to do if you think you have covid-19 2. declutter and clean before you disinfect once you\\'ve sorted out your supplies, macnamara said the next thing to do is clean. \"get the dirt out first ... before you disinfect. so start cleaning, wipe up. i use the example \\'wipe up that spaghetti sauce first before you try to disinfect,\\'\" he said. 3. read the instructions when it\\'s time to disinfect, macnamara said to read the instructions for how long to leave the cleaning product on those surfaces. that\\'s the key in actually killing those germs. experts recommend leaving the product on the surface for about a minute before you wipe it away. 4. don\\'t cross-contaminate macnamara said people should also keep in mind cross-contamination. don\\'t use the same cloth to clean the toilet and the sink. he said a good way to remember which cloth is for which surface is to use different colours. when you\\'re done, throw them in the laundry on the hot setting and then wash your hands. 5. sanitize twice a day macnamara suggests disinfecting twice a day. if that seems like a lot, he said families can try getting everyone involved. \"the kids are home from school, let them do it,\" he said. \"put some gloves on and make sure you clean in the mornings and in the evenings, before you go to bed is helpful and smile doing it.\" covid-19: what you need to know what are the symptoms of covid-19? common symptoms include: fever. cough. tiredness.

(adrian wyld / canadian press) a majority of canadians who voted for either the conservatives or the bloc québécois, however, think the federal government is doing a bad job. these voters also tend to be concentrated in western canada and quebec, where the federal government\\'s handling of the issue rated worst. nevertheless, 33 per cent of conservative voters said the federal government is doing a good job, an increase of 10 points. the poll was conducted before some of the latest moves that were made by the federal government, including monday\\'s restriction on entry into the country by non-residents and non-u.s. citizens. how these numbers evolve in the coming days and weeks will provide a revealing glimpse of how canadians are handling the pandemic themselves — and whether they will continue to put faith in their institutions. some in yellowknife\\'s food and drink industry say they\\'re feeling the impacts of covid-19 — even before there are any confirmed cases in the territory — but that it\\'s too soon to tell if a federal package for workers and small businesses will ease the blow. as people spend less time in public spaces downtown to slow the spread of covid-19, several businesses in the territory\\'s capital have temporarily shuttered, including the black knight pub and birchwood coffee kǫ̀. a press release from birchwood coffee co-owner patrick

virus was being transmitted, i saw that it was from close contact. people weren\\'t getting it out on the street, they were getting it at home from their family members,\" said the computer science instructor at the university of british columbia. baniassad is one of a handful of people making use of the reams of data being collected and published daily around the world to help governments and citizens plan and be informed of the latest situation. her diagrams are published on virihealth.com, a website started by someone in toronto to keep track of the information released by the provinces. welcome to humanity\\'s first data-driven pandemic. when detailed data on each new covid-19 case was released by the b.c. government, it was possible to trace how the virus was transmitted. (elisa baniassad/virihealth.com) \"this pandemic is unprecedented, and the amount of data sharing is unprecedented,\" said david buckeridge, a professor of epidemiology at mcgill university\\'s medical school. \"i\\'ve never seen this much activity of people making data so openly available.\" every day, countries and regional governments are releasing the number of new cases, tests conducted, deaths and recoveries. in some cases, they release how new infections are linked to others and how the virus is mutating as it hops borders. this allows researchers to do quick analyses and forecast future infections, along with better advising governments and citizens on how to respond, buckeridge said. his team, in fact, received federal funding to measure countries\\' responses based on new daily cases. \"we\\'re been trending towards this over time, being open and releasing data as it\\'s generated,\" said allison black, a phd candidate in epidemiology at the university of washington in seattle. she is one of several people behind nextstrain, a website that traces the genetic mutations of the novel coronavirus and other pathogens for laboratory researchers to use. \"the release of coronavirus data has been incredibly inspiring. the scale that it\\'s happening at is new,\" black said. elisa baniassad, an instructor at the university of british columbia in vancouver, was able to track how covid-19 cases in b.c. were being transmitted thanks to data released. (maggie macpherson/cbc) canada case data hard to compile in canada, daily news about new covid-19 cases comes from provincial health authorities, often in inconsistent ways, and compiling it into a single national dataset is challenging. still, some have stepped up. isha berry, a phd student at the university of toronto\\'s dalla lana school of public health, assembled a team that scans provincial releases each day and standardizes the data in one spreadsheet, which is publicly available. but a spreadsheet makes it hard to see how the disease is evolving in canada, so her team made an online dashboard that shows a daily portrait in a visual way. \"it allows people to see summaries at national level, to see what\\'s happening in a clearer way,\" berry said. nextstrain.org traces the genetic mutations of pathogens like the coronavirus as it spreads around the globe. (nextstrain) another canadian effort to collate and simplify information is virihealth.com, started by a project manager in toronto. the world\\'s largest maker of mapping software, esri, is using the daily data from virihealth to power its own canadian dashboard, released last friday, which has the most granular geographic breakdown of cases. esri has clients in all levels of government, and they\\'re all asking for help to better plan responses and resources, said chris north, the company\\'s director of technology adoption. \"a lot of them don\\'t have time to react. they are dealing with other aspects of the crisis,\" he said. esri is also crossing global pandemic data with its own data on socioeconomic measures to see if it can identify areas that could be hit harder by the virus to help their customers prioritize responses. data details slim as cases grow baniassad is no longer able to trace how the virus is being transmitted in b.c. the data put out by the british columbia government was detailed in the first few days but as the numbers grow, it\\'s down to the bare essentials: number of new daily cases, deaths and recoveries. other provincial governments seem to be doing the same. \"it\\'s frustrating because now they\\'re just giving aggregate numbers for the population,\" baniassad said. it\\'s no longer possible to see how many new cases are linked, for example, to an initial cluster at the lynn valley care centre in vancouver. as the number of covid-19 cases mounts in canada, there are fewer details released about each. this makes it harder for the public to see how the disease is being transmitted. (esri canada) she compares it to singapore, which continues to release detailed information on each case, including clusters of infection, such as 23 cases linked to a church or 47 cases at a dinner party. \"it\\'s calming for people to have a sense that they\\'re being fully informed,\" she said. \"my mother likes going to church. having full knowledge where the infection clusters are, we can make more informed decisions.\" resources to keep up with the covid-19 pandemic canada-specific: dashboard from the university of toronto\\'s dalla lana school of public health esri canada dashboard and community risk profiles virihealth radio-canada dashboard (french) global: johns hopkins csse dashboard healthmap, an animated map of global cases ncov2019live by avi schiffman, a high schooler in washington state nextstrain to work from home or not to work from home. that is the question. the answer, however, isn\\'t straightforward, say employers struggling to stay afloat while trying to do the right thing to stop the spread of covid-19. not all workers can work from home, says philip van leeuwen, vice-president of communications for nordia, which bills itself as \"canada\\'s largest provider of customer service solutions.\" numbers as of march 18. (cbc news) while many new brunswick call centres have sent some of their employees home to work remotely, nordia\\'s two locations — in saint john and moncton — are relatively business as usual. \"very few of our operations people are able to work from home because we need them online,\" said van leeuwen. while moncton has several administrative positions — and those people have been encouraged to work from home — van leeuwen described saint john as an \"operational centre.\" that means working from home isn\\'t an option. n.b. covid-19 roundup: 3 new cases bring total to 11 \"i\\'m not aware of anyone [in the saint john office] who could work from home,\" said van leeuwen.. \"most of those folks have to come into our centres. that\\'s why we\\'re spending so much effort in maintaining the safety and security of those centres. it\\'s really our top priority.\" he said the company has stepped up cleaning and sanitizing protocols and is ensuring that employees work at a safe distance from each other. as of wednesday, the temperature of every employee will be taken before they\\'re permitted to start their shift. if they have a fever, they are sent home, said van leeuwen. elsewhere, it\\'s work at home other call centres, however, are sending employees home to work. public spaces were urged to close by chief medical officer of health jennifer russell. 1:16 td insurance, for example, is trying to send as many of its saint john staff as possible to work from home without compromising service for customers, says spokesperson elizabeth goldenshtein. after all, some of their clients may be travelling abroad and need information on health and travel insurance, she said. \"like many regulated and vital functions, insurance is obligated to remain open, and some of our colleagues are still working from td locations as a necessary function of their role for canadians,\" explained goldenshtein in an email. small businesses scramble for cash flow in face of covid-19 closures she said many are \"working tirelessly to help get canadians who are travelling abroad home. these customers need our support more urgently than ever to understand their insurance coverage and policies.\" with staffing levels reduced at their offices, goldenshtein said the company is able to allow for social distancing at work. they are also moving employees \"between locations or floors or both in order to limit the spread and impact of the virus.\" figuring it out john wishart, the ceo of the chamber of commerce for greater moncton, said employers are doing their best in a difficult situation. he hasn\\'t heard any pushback from employers about sending employees home to work, nor any complaints from employees who are asked to report to the office. \"i haven\\'t heard any reports of employees being forced to stay at work,\" he said. \"that\\'s a good sign. i think it means that the business community is certainly taking the public health scare seriously.\" john wishart, ceo of the chamber of commerce for greater moncton, said employers didn\\'t have much time to prepare for covid-19 but are doing their best in a difficult situation. (chamber of commerce for greater moncton website) since everything happened so fast, wishart said, most employers didn\\'t have time to prepare. \"we are directing our members, if they have inquiries about how to work from home remotely, to some resources that we\\'re aware of, some software that\\'s out there, especially free software.\" he said one of the issues that has already surfaced is a strain on communications infrastructure. wishart said he\\'s already experiencing difficulties with conference calls and was warned by the service provider that there may be delays or other glitches in the coming weeks. lessons for next time he said the company acknowledged it wasn\\'t ready for the avalanche of traffic caused by the increase in remote workers. if there\\'s a silver lining in all of this, wishart said companies can use the covid-19 experience to help develop future contingency plans. \"so, the next time around — if there is a next time — we\\'ll be more capable or ready,\" he said. the ceo and co-founder of beauceron security inc., a new brunswick-based cybersecurity software firm with clients across north america, sees the same silver lining. beauceron security ceo david shipley says there’s no technological silver bullet, but there are things that employers can do to ensure the safety of their workers and their business when employees work from home. (jennifer sweet/cbc) \"when we come through this,\" said david shipley, \"i think we\\'ll all be better for it, in terms of being more resilient. i do believe that the painful things we\\'re going through now will help us in less dire situations. \"in the next flu season, maybe people will take it more seriously about working from home if you\\'re not feeling well. and employers will feel more confident that people can still be productive at home and not have to come into the office. i think there is a lot of good that can come from this terrible situation in the long run.\" and for those struggling with the prospect of sending employees home to work, shipley\\'s company has prepared an information document titled \"cybersecurity for remote workers\" to help them through these tough times. no readymade solution \"unfortunately, due to the speed of this pandemic, a lot of organizations have not had the opportunity to think through these things,\" he said. \"there\\'s no technological silver bullet. there is no hardware or software that you can buy and immediately you\\'ve got a fully productive, remote workforce.\" but there are things that employers can do to ensure the safety of their workers and their business. \"the first thing is to understand that people are not going to work the same way that they did at the office,\" said shipley. the next step is to make sure that the equipment and networks are secure. as their powerpoint presentation stresses, \"if remote workers aren\\'t following security best practices, the whole organization is still at risk.\" as museums close, travel and large gatherings are restricted and major events, including professional sports, come to a grinding halt to limit the spread of covid-19, there will be a heavier reliance on entertainment that can be enjoyed at home. during periods of crisis, people might be more mindful of their spending but also have much more idle time, says canadian matthew ball, former head of strategy for amazon studios. \"this will be good for any entertainment experience with a low-entry cost and that can sustain many, many hours of use,\" ball said. that includes a lot of subscription streaming services, such as amazon prime video, disney plus and netflix. \"there\\'s going be a lot of load placed on the platforms. that\\'s for sure,\" said guy marion, ceo of san francisco-based audience and subscription consulting firm, brightback. \"i wouldn\\'t be surprised if we start to see more outages, more delays, more bandwidth issues and support issues in the coming few weeks, as the load goes up massively on these streaming companies.\" broadway, disneyland shut down due to covid-19 as hollywood clears release calendar from binge-watching to virtual museum tours, here are a few entertainment options to help distract, inform and ride out the isolation. #quarantineandchill while doomsday films, such as the gwyneth paltrow-led contagion (2011) and dustin hoffman-starring outbreak (1995) might be seeing renewed interest, there are plenty of escapist series to binge-watch. series such as succession, fleabag, game of thrones and chernobyl are the most recent emmy and golden globe winners. science or science fiction? what contagion gets right — and wrong — about pandemics schitt\\'s creek, the good place and the marvelous mrs. maisel were among this year\\'s emmy nominees acclaimed as much for their comedy as for being a source of wholesome comfort. succession, about a wealthy family\\'s internal feud for power, is among this year\\'s award-winning shows to binge-watch if stuck at home for prolonged periods.

testing protocols were rolled out by the province late last week, and dr. hsiu-li wang, the region\\'s acting medical officer of health, says it means people with mild symptoms who are suspected to have covid-19 won\\'t be tested. \"we do not have an unlimited supply of test kits,\" wang said. \"we need to proactively prioritize these test kits for people that are either going to be more sick and will be treated in hospital or that care for people that are more vulnerable, such as healthcare workers, long-term care workers.\" wang said if someone is in the hospital and is ill, knowing they have covid-19 means how that patient is treated may change. \"we need to know the test results in order to be able to manage their care appropriately,\" she said. a health care worker who may have symptoms but tests negative could continue to work, she added. \"for most cases, it\\'s going to be mild or milder, and they\\'re going to be able to recover at home,\" wang said. \"we don\\'t have enough swabs to test all the mild cases in the community, and it doesn\\'t change the course of what we do with them. in other words, we\\'re going to still ask them to stay at home and self isolate

the coronavirus. of that, two people are in the hospital, but both are in stable condition. in those cases, wang says they know the people either knew a person who also had covid-19 or had travelled from the same area as other cases. wang said there\\'s no evidence the virus is spreading in the community yet, but she anticipates it will happen. \"that is coming,\" she said. \"we\\'re starting to

when it comes to the spread of covid-19 in ottawa, the situation might almost seem encouraging. and it is tempting to take solace from some bona fide good news. after a spike last sunday in new cases of people testing positive for covid-19, the numbers have tapered off in the past few days. only one new case was identified on each of monday and wednesday, while no new cases were reported on tuesday. what you need to know about covid-19 in ottawa as well, most of the 14 people who have tested positive so far have reported mild symptoms. even the person in their 60s who has been hospitalized with the illness is not in intensive care. but ottawa\\'s chief medical officer of health is warning residents not to fall prey to complacency. the unsettling reality is that there are probably hundreds of people in the capital right now unknowingly infected with the novel coronavirus. \"there is a high likelihood it\\'s here in our community and so we need to act that way,\" dr. vera etches told cbc. \"it\\'s not like the risk has gone away. i expect more cases because we have more and more returning travellers and we probably have transmission in the community that we

in which health care officials are screening may skew the numbers toward travellers in a way that doesn\\'t fully capture the real shape of the covid-19 situation. we can\\'t find all of those hundreds of cases. we can\\'t test for all of those. we don\\'t know who they are.- dr. vera etches, chief medical officer the confirmed cases we\\'ve seen in the last eight days are the result of illness that is linked to travel over the past couple of weeks. there was a risk to travellers then, and as more people are returning to canada, \"that risk continues and grows,\" said etches. right now, health workers are largely testing people with mild symptoms and who\\'ve travelled in the last two weeks or been in close contact with someone who has tested positive. at the brewer park arena assessment centre, more than 1,800 people who presumably fit that criteria have been tested since last friday. the hospital staff at the brewer park arena covid-19 assessment centre have tested more than 1,500 people. (justin tang/canadian press) however, people with mild, flu-like symptoms who have no connection to travel are generally not being tested. it is not feasible to test everyone who has a cough or slight fever. still, some of these untested individuals may, in fact, be infected with the virus. \"we can\\'t find all of those hundreds of cases,\" said etches. \"we can\\'t test for all of those. we don\\'t know who they are.\" that\\'s why staff are beginning to screen anyone who comes into a hospital for possible coronavirus symptoms — in particular a fever, cough and shortness of breath. \"anyone could have been in contact with someone in the community and become infected,\" she said. \\'imagine\\' you\\'ve come in contact with the virus etches wants people to \"imagine that you could have come in contact with the virus.\" act like you might be infectious, especially around older adults, who are at greater risk if they fall ill with covid-19. that means self-isolating not only for 14 days after returning to canada or when you\\'re feeling unwell — and for 24 hours after your symptoms subside — but limiting most social interaction for everybody. \"the less the better,\" said etches. for example, if you need another family to watch your child while you go to your essential job, then fine. otherwise \"play dates are kind of optional.\" etches said she realizes that the extreme limiting of social interaction, which will likely be needed in coming weeks, can be daunting and difficult. \"it\\'s something we all have to help each other with,\" she said, adding that even her own family was already feeling \"testy.\" \"but it\\'s important,\" she said. \"you look at the facts — that the fatality rate for people over 80 is 20 percent — and we just we just don\\'t want to see that.\" with strong <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/socialdistancing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5etfw\">#socialdistancing</a> to decrease covid-19 transmission, tensions may run high in the home. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/physicalactivity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5etfw\">#physicalactivity</a> can help. what ideas do you have for in-home or outdoor-2metre-apart activities?

(stéphanie blanchet / radio-canada) but these candidates have not met the thresholds for gathering signatures or raising funds that would put them on the ballot. derek sloan and erin o\\'toole, both ontario mps, have met those thresholds — both are calling on the party to postpone the leadership decision. o\\'toole is considered to be one of two front runners, along with former cabinet minister peter mackay. on sunday, o\\'toole put out a video asking the conservative party to delay the race so that volunteers, members and donors can concentrate their efforts on fighting covid-19. mackay, however, sent an email to supporters on monday making the case for the leadership vote to be accelerated in order to select a \"new permanent leader as quickly as possible so our parliamentary democracy can function as constitutionally intended.\" leslyn lewis, a lawyer who has run for the party in the past, said she did not support changing the leadership date and that the next leader must be \"battle-tested.\" challengers lead calls for delay one common thread running between these calls for the postponement of leadership races is that the front runners largely haven\\'t been leading them. alexandre cusson, a former mayor of drummondville, was alone in calling for the postponement of the quebec liberal leadership race; his only opponent in that race is high-profile former cabinet minister dominique anglade, widely seen as the front runner. in newfoundland and labrador, favourite andrew furey — orthopedic surgeon and son of george furey, the speaker in the senate — only joined the calls for a suspension of the liberal leadership on friday, after his lower-profile opponent, john abbott, criticized both furey and the party for the initial plans to go ahead. andrew furey is one of two candidates, along with john abbott, running for the leadership of the newfoundland and labrador liberal party. the winner will become the next premier of the province, but the race has been postponed until further notice because of covid-19. (douglas gaulton / canadian press) in the federal conservative leadership race, sloan is a first-term mp with no caucus endorsements, while o\\'toole trails mackay on that front by a margin of 31 to 11. opposition parties across the country have been carefully finding their way forward in these unprecedented times — striving for less partisanship and more constructive opposition. they\\'re calculating that this is what the public expects from opposition politicians in the midst of a national crisis. leadership races, however, are inherently partisan. the target audience is not the general population but its most politicized segments. if criticizing a government struggling with a global pandemic is seen as an act of bad taste, internecine squabbling between fellow-travellers must seem doubly so at a time like this. there are both self-interested and sincere explanations for why front runners might want to get a leadership race over with as soon as possible, and why challengers would call for politics to be put aside while there are bigger problems to be confronted. but right about now, everyone is looking for leadership. for political parties, that makes it a tough time to be looking for a leader — or to be leaderless. all sworn members of the edmonton police service from detective on down have been told to be ready to return to the front lines because of the coronavirus. it\\'s a possibility if large numbers of officers are quarantined or test positive for the virus. the head of the edmonton police association said so far there have been no cases among eps members. sgt. michael elliott admitted some members are nervous while others are calling his office looking for more information. \"as first responders, we need to be there physically and mentally prepared to help the citizens,\" elliott told cbc news. \"we\\'ve got to take care of our own families and we\\'ve got to take care of the citizens. so education goes both ways and we\\'ve got to be that calming feature for the public.\" \\'make sure your kit is ready\\' officers used to working in plainclothes have been told to pull out their uniforms. \"all members are being notified to make sure your kit is ready, and if called upon your primary responsibility is on the front line and taking care of the citizens, and that\\'s what you have to do,\" elliott said. \"so if i\\'m a member in robbery and in the worst-case scenario i\\'m required, then he or she will go get their uniform and kit and get ready and go back on the front line.\" eps spokesperson scott pattison confirmed some members are in self-isolation, but there have been no positive tests. meanwhile, members who are used to dealing with potentially high-risk health situations continue to take precautions, including the use of gloves and hand sanitizer. it\\'s unclear if masks will be provided in the future. elliott said responding officers try to determine if a person is showing symptoms before they get too close. if so, they keep their distance whenever possible, though officers can\\'t stay two metres away if they have to handcuff someone. sgt. mike elliott is president of the edmonton police association.

(niaid-rml/the associated press) the community of southend is reporting a presumptive case of covid-19. a statement from the northern inter-tribal health authority said a test for covid-19 was carried out in the community, located roughly 450 kilometres north of prince albert, on march 11. \"the individual is well and self-isolating,\" the statement said. the saskatchewan health authority said the ministry of health was in charge of reporting and confirming cases of covid-19. an email from the ministry of health said that department was awaiting response from the northern inter-tribal health authority. \"dr. nnamdi ndubuka is the medical health officer for northern inter-tribal health authority which is a first nations organization,\" the email said, adding the ministry needed to look into the matter further. around 8:10 p.m. cst, after this story initially published, the province issued a news release that said a resident in northern saskatchewan was one of four new presumptive cases of covid-19 in the province. it was not immediately clear if this case is related. calls to the northern inter-tribal health authority were not immediately returned. chief peter a. beatty of the peter ballantyne cree nation, which is under the northern inter-tribal health authority\\'s jurisdiction and has a reserve that shares borders with southend, confirmed there was a presumptive case of covid-19 in southend. \"one of our nurses was tested positive for covid-19 — presumptive case, of course,\" beatty told cbc news. \"that will have to be sent to winnipeg for confirmation, so we\\'ll be waiting for that to confirm.\" beatty said he believed the nurse contracted the virus through international travel, but didn\\'t know where they had travelled. he said the people the nurse had contact with while working at the clinic have since been located and are isolated. they\\'re being monitored and anyone showing symptoms will be tested. preventative measures taken beatty said as a preventative measure, community members in all peter ballantyne cree nation communities, including southend, are being asked to restrict non-essential travel. beatty said schools in peter ballantyne cree nation communities will be shut down for three weeks. the notice published by the northern inter-tribal health authority asked residents to wash their hands, practice good hygiene and social distancing measures. band staff were asked to work from home where possible for the time being, beatty said, as a precautionary measure. \"we\\'re doing the best we can to mitigate, and to monitor the ones who were in close contact to the individual,\" beatty said. beatty said he was recently in toronto and although he\\'s not showing any symptoms of being sick, he\\'s trying to self-isolate himself as much as possible. \"i\\'m just taking precautionary measures, trying to set an example,\" he said. the calgary board of education says its top priority is gearing up to offer learning online, especially for students in high school, now that the province has cancelled all k-12 classes due to the covid-19 pandemic. alberta\\'s education minister says online learning for students is an option that\\'s being looked at for the entire province, but it needs to be equitable, no matter where the students are. at a news conference monday, cbe chair marilyn dennis said the school district is working diligently to put plans in place to support student learning, as well as getting positive messaging to students. \"this is a rapidly evolving situation and we don\\'t know exactly what it means for classes to be cancelled indefinitely,\" dennis said. \"we will work to support our students regardless of how long it takes to get them back in our schools.\" the province announced sunday that classes in all k-12 schools in alberta have been cancelled and child-care centres have been closed indefinitely due to the ongoing covid-19 cases. dennis said that despite class cancellations, teachers are at school and working diligently to put plans in place to support student learning. calgary school boards prep online courses joanne pitman, superintendent of school improvement for the cbe, said online resources for students are being prepared and that high school students, particularly those in grade 12, are the main priority for having programs readily available. joanne pitman, superintendent of school improvement for the cbe, says they understand that providing online resources is not the only priority. (cbc) \"we want to ensure that our grade 12 students have the necessary credentials to be able to pursue post-secondary. we have prioritized our high school programming first and we\\'ll be working through communication again,\" she said. pitman added that while the schools have lots of online resources available, the cbe acknowledges the difficulties and that students will need to prepare for school looking a lot different in the near future. \"this is going to be a significant challenge to pretend that all elements of delivery of continuity of education will remain of the same quality and design. simply replacing what is happening in a classroom physically is not realistic and one that we are going to need to grapple with,\" she said. she said the cbe will also be looking to build transition supports and best practices for communicating during these uncertain times. at the calgary catholic school district, bryan szumlas, the chief superintendent, said it\\'s also working on bolstering online education but a lot is still unknown. he said calgary catholic teachers are being asked to make sure they have a contact list for all of the students that they work with, as well as planning their daily lessons. \"it\\'s still too early in the process to let everyone know the path forward and what that looks like but we are working on it.\" chris usih, chief superintendent of schools for the cbe, said the school district is working closely with the province and other school jurisdictions. he said they have a team of individuals who have been working for weeks on online readiness and that there is a willingness to collaborate with other jurisdictions on best delivery. \"i think we recognize that this is the first day of what is a very unique experience for our students and our families,\" he said. chief superintendent chris usih says the cbe is working closely with the province and other school jurisdictions. (cbc) \"as we move along, we\\'ll adjust based on what\\'s happening in our district here in calgary but also across the province.\" education minister not committed to online courses the province said that while online learning for students is definitely an option that\\'s on the table, it\\'s not something the government is committed to yet. \"the biggest thing is we want to make sure that it\\'s an equitable level of education that every kid gets. we don\\'t want those that have better access to only get it because they\\'re in downtown calgary,\" said colin aitchison on behalf of alberta education minister adriana lagrange. online distance learning has grown in recent years across the province, and lagrange said 32 jurisdictions have it readily available. \"we will be in contact with all of them. we also have the alberta distance learning centre as well,\" she said. \"we have gathered all the superintendents together on teleconferences and we are developing next steps so that we can provide a co-ordinated approach right across the province on how we can move forward,\" said lagrange. feeling lonely in these days of self-isolation? try an indoor garden. houseplants make good company, says anita mcdonald. as the co-owner of kuhlmann\\'s greenhouse garden market, mcdonald has spent her career in the northeast edmonton greenhouse — to her, \"the best place to be.\" she\\'s encouraging novice gardeners to create their own indoor oasis as a way to cope with the pressures of the covid-19 pandemic. for people cooped up at home, tending a garden can be \"a breath of fresh air,\" she said. \"it\\'s the perfect time right now,\" mcdonald said in an interview tuesday with cbc radio\\'s edmonton am. even though there is snow on the ground in edmonton, there is no reason to limit your green thumb to the great outdoors, mcdonald said. for many people, an indoor garden is a way to get a head start on the spring planting season. \"we know this weather is not going to last forever and eventually these things can go outside,\" mcdonald said. \"you want to be careful not to start anything that grows too quickly. but flower seeds, peppers, tomatoes and herbs, those can all be started indoors in little pots as long as you have a good window.\" the basics: good tools, good light before you let anything take root, take stock of the sunny spaces available in your home. you will need plenty of good light, she said. for a smaller selection of plants, choose a windowsill or kitchen table with a west or south exposure. larger gardening projects could be undertaken in a light-filled room in the basement or a heated shed with proper lighting. \"make sure your pots have holes in the bottom and make sure you put your pots on a saucer or a tray and that will collect water so you don\\'t make a mess everywhere,\" she added. to get started, invest in basic gardening tools, appropriately-sized planters and good potting soil. for seedlings, look for starter soil with lots of fertilizer or buy starter plants that you can nurture indoors, she said. \"we do have some starter plants and seedlings that customers can purchase, for petunias and pansies, marigolds and peppers, even begonias,\" mcdonald said \"they\\'re a little bit of a cheaper price right now so you can get them now and grow them indoors until they\\'re ready to go outdoors.\" a few of your favourite things think carefully about what you want to plant, mcdonald cautioned. pick too many different varieties and you may end up overwhelmed with sickly plants. \"start slow and don\\'t try to do too many things at one time,\" mcdonald said. \"don\\'t think you\\'re going to suddenly grow 50 different things indoors because you\\'re probably going to run into some problems. don\\'t go overboard. \"pick a few of your favourite things or things that you know are something that your family really enjoys to eat and concentrate on those things.\" #quarantineandchill: binge-worthy shows, podcasts and movies to keep you occupied kuhlmann\\'s greenhouse is still operating. it\\'s planting season and the greenhouses need tending, so the business is reluctant to close, mcdonald said. they\\'re offering a pre-order service that allows customers to make an order over the phone and pick up their purchases in the parking lot, she said. \"our store is quiet. it\\'s not really busy. we usually have four or five customers at one time so there is a lot of room to walk around and social distance,\" she said. \"we\\'re just taking it day to day.\" from shopping to playgrounds: your coronavirus questions answered a london woman who works in health care and has no history of travel is one of 22 new patients who has tested positive for covid-19 in ontario. the ministry of health released new information saturday morning showing the number of positive cases has risen to 101. a positive case from huron perth public health was also listed. there are no details about where that person is living or if they had travelled in recent weeks. the middlesex london health unit (mlhu) said the london patient is in her 50s and does not work at a hospital. for privacy reasons, officials would not say where she works or what she does. primary care could mean anything from a doctor\\'s office to a clinic. \"the person had contact with about 10 people at one point but we\\'re confident those people are safe. they\\'re in self-isolation and there\\'s no risk beyond the people we\\'ve already notified,\" said dr. chris mackie, officer of health for the mlhu. he said the woman has mild symptoms of the virus and is also at home in self-isolation. a dozen other londoners awaiting test results because the woman has no history of travel, health officials are currently trying to determine if she was in contact with someone who had been out of the country. \"that\\'s still to be determined. from my perspective that doesn\\'t change what we do. we\\'re on the verge of community spread, and we\\'re taking appropriate measures,\" mackie said. the patient was tested at the london health sciences centre (paula duhatschek/cbc) the patient was screened at the london health sciences centre but other hospitals are also doing tests. mackie said there are currently about a dozen people in the london area who are waiting on test results. this is the second case of the coronavirus in london. a western university student tested positive on jan. 24 after returning from wuhan, china. meantime, western university confirmed friday that a student studying in spain was hospitalized in that country after contracting the virus, but is currently recovering. as cree territory\\'s popular spring goose hunt approaches, officials in northern quebec are asking people not to go hunt in the south over fears of covid-19. the cree trappers association and the cree board of health and social services of james bay have issued a joint statement asking hunters to abandon plans to hunt in the south this year in places near montreal and ottawa, such as alfred, ontario. \"we want our hunters to reconsider going hunting down south because there is a presence [of covid-19] in ottawa and our hunters go to ottawa. there\\'s also presence in southern quebec,\" said fred tomatuk, president of the cree trappers association. goose break is a centuries-old tradition practiced by cree in northern quebec, where communities all but close down for a few weeks, usually in may, to hunt returning geese and spend time with family and friends. fred tomatuk is the president of the cree trappers association. (fred tomatuk/facebook) while there are no official numbers, tomatuk said over the last five or ten years, the southern goose hunt has become increasingly popular for cree hunters. the concern is that this year, because of the covid-19 outbreak, hunters may bring the virus back to cree communities, said tomatuk. \"you may pick it up and transport it and pass it to your family and your community,\" said tomatuk. as of monday, there were no cases of covid-19 in quebec cree communities, but there were four cases in the abitibi region, as well as one case in the community of chibougamau, where many cree go to shop. both tomatuk and officials at the cbhssjb are encouraging hunters to get out on the land, but to stick close to home. \"goose break in the forest is probably the way to go,\" said faisca richer, director of public health at cree board of health. \"[but] it\\'s safer to stay on the [cree] territory.\" over the past five or ten years, hunting geese in the south, in places like alfred, ont. has become increasingly popular with quebec cree families. (stanley saganash/facebook) richer added that cree hunters who do go to their traditional camps should make sure they are able to communicate with the outside world and keep people up to date, should anyone start showing symptoms of covid-19. tomatuk agrees that going out on the land is a good way for cree families to be protected from the virus. \"the hunting was always good there and we\\'re recommending everybody to go to their individual camps,\" said tomatuk, adding cree hunters should be able to return to the southern goose hunt next year. dr. deena hinshaw, alberta\\'s chief medical officer of health, has been giving daily updates on the covid-19 situation (until this past weekend where she took off some time to spend with her family). albertans have noticed, even creating a t-shirt in her honour. (the canadian press/whatwoulddrhinshawdo.ca) a calgary school\\'s assistant principal was so inspired by the daily covid-19 updates from alberta\\'s chief medical officer of health she came up with a shirt that is raising thousands of dollars for children and food banks across the province. \"she is just so remarkable in the way she manages this massive amount of information in a way that makes people feel calm and supported,\" alison van rosendaal told cbc news. \"she does it with a generosity of spirit.\" van rosendaal says dr. deena hinshaw is more than just a reliable source of information many albertans have come to count on. alison van rosendaal, right, had an idea late one night to honour the work of alberta\\'s chief medical officer of health, dr. deena hinshaw. these t-shirts have raised about $9,000, as of sunday afternoon, for food banks and food-insecure school children.

(alberta health services) a western university studying in spain has contracted covid-19, according to the university. in a statement, the university said the student\\'s condition is improving after being hospitalized and treated. it\\'s not known when the student tested positive for covid-19, but two other western students in spain have been placed in self-isolation as a precautionary measure. western president alan shepard first shared the news during a senate meeting on campus friday. president shepard just said there is western student abroad in spain who contracted the virus, who is \"not doing very well\"&mdash;@_raniaosman_ the family of the affected student has since been notified. london, ont. woman is 3rd confirmed coronavirus case in ontario so far, london, ont. has had one confirmed case of covid-19—a female western university student in her 20s contracted the virus while travelling from wuhan in late january. she has since made a full recovery. a biotechnology company in quebec city that previously developed and mass produced a flu vaccine says it has produced a potential vaccine for covid-19. this is not yet a coronavirus vaccine — at this stage it is a \"vaccine candidate\" that could still prove to be ineffective during several steps and test phases. but as scientists around the world race to find a vaccine, the 20-day turnaround by the company, medicago, is notable: vaccine candidates are typically developed on a scale of months or more. \"we can produce a vaccine candidate very quickly once a pandemic is declared,\" said nathalie landry, medicago\\'s executive vice-president of scientific and medical affairs. \"we can scale up very quickly and produce a large number of doses. if you think of influenza, for example, it takes anything from four to six months before vaccine doses are produced.\" medicago\\'s vaccine candidate is moving at a \"very fast pace,\" and will proceed to safety and efficacy testing in animals in the coming weeks, landry said. human trials could begin as early as july, the company says. medicago uses \"virus-like particles\" — molecules that mimic the form of a virus, but without the infectious properties — that can trigger a human\\'s immune system to create antibodies that can fight the actual virus. dr. gary kobinger, shown in a 2019 file photo, heads the infectious disease research centre at laval university. (cbc) the technology is like a photocopy of the virus and permits an \"extremely fast\" turnaround, said dr. gary kobinger, head of the infectious disease research centre at laval university, whose lab is working with several vaccine candidates, including medicago\\'s. \"a virus-like particle is exactly the same thing as the virus itself without anything inside,\" kobinger said. \"it\\'s an empty shell with the same outside, but the inside is completely empty. there\\'s no way it can replicate. there\\'s no genetic information, no protein, nothing.\" medicago\\'s system means \"you can engineer it very easily by getting the protein of whatever virus is going around and swap it in,\" said dr. marc-andré langlois, a professor in the faculty of medicine at the university of ottawa, who is working on another vaccine candidate and is not involved with medicago\\'s work. cbc explainsdo i have covid-19, the flu or a cold? \"the advantage is that you can get it done extremely quickly. it can result in excellent candidates that can produce a vaccine.\" kobinger\\'s research group is also using medicago\\'s technology to try to develop a therapeutic treatment for people already stricken by covid-19, using copies of the antibodies found in the systems of people who were infected with the virus and have since recovered. landry said that medicago\\'s previous successful vaccine projects, including a flu vaccine developed in 2012, gives high confidence that the covid-19 vaccine candidate will work, though she noted there are no guarantees. vaccine ready in one year is \\'miracle\\' scenario the company\\'s technology uses plants — instead of animal cells or eggs — to mass produce vaccines, which means scaling up to deliver vaccine doses to millions can be done more quickly than with traditional vaccine manufacturing processes. kobinger says the technology is extremely promising, but even a \"miracle\" scenario would mean a vaccine reaching the public a year from now with proper testing. \"if they enter phase one clinical trials in july [or] august, you could see phase two in december … and phase three in maybe march of next year,\" he said. \"if we did that, we would beat all records.\" all experts emphasize that the testing process is a crucial step. a vaccine candidate could prove to be unsafe, or it could be safe and effective in animal testing and have no effect on humans. \"every virus is slightly different,\" langlois said. \"i think no one can predict if something can be safe and effective until it is tested.\" if you think you have symptoms of covid-19, call 1-877-644-4545 before heading to a hospital or a clinic to seek testing. do not call 811 as that service is receiving more calls than it can handle. the quebec government is also posting up-to-date information on this website. on tuesday night, bailey grose posted in a prince george community facebook group about an idea she had to get people to paste hearts in their windows to start a community-wide scavenger hunt. in less than three days, she received photos of more than 700 hearts and the post had been shared by more than 1,100 people. \"it has been incredible,\" said grose. the mother of two was looking for something for her girls to do while they are at home social distancing because of covid-19. \"i am attempting to bring the community together without any social interaction,\" she told radio west host sarah penton. grose has received over 700 photos of hearts people have put in their windows.

the covid-19 respiratory illness is likely taking place in ottawa, according to the city\\'s chief medical officer of health. that pronouncement from dr. vera etches comes as the province\\'s ministry of health reported five new confirmed cases of covid-19 in ottawa sunday morning, bringing the city\\'s total to 10. the ministry said ontario has 39 new cases of the respiratory illness, increasing the total infected to 142. all five local cases are in self-isolation, according to the ministry. ottawa public health (oph) confirmed that all 10 cases of covid-19 in ottawa are related to travel or contact with someone who has a confirmed case, including some who had contact with cases in toronto. at a press conference sunday, etches urged people to cancel events of all sizes in order to reduce transmission and limit unimportant trips out of their homes. \"i recommend that they don\\'t go out for non-essential reasons,\" etches said. take kids out of daycares etches asked parents sunday to take their children out of daycare if possible. all daycares are being asked to screen anyone who comes into their environment, she said, and should not allow any children who have been out of the country in the last 14 days. ottawa\\'s covid-19 assessment centre turning many away \"these guidelines are not meant to say, \\'you must stay in your home!\\'\" etches said in a statement issued sunday night. \"you can still go outside to take a walk, go to the park, or walk your dog. if you need groceries, go to the store. we simply recommend that while outside you make sure to avoid crowds and maintain a distance of [one to two metres] from those around you.\" dr. vera etches, with ottawa public health, says local transmission of covid-19 in ottawa may mean there are several hundred cases currently in the community. the agency is encouraging residents to strengthen social distancing measures, keeping one to two metres away from others. 1:32 etches also said the city\\'s assessment centre at the brewer arena saw around 250 people on friday and about 300 on saturday. as of noon sunday, 63 people had been tested. only around half of people who\\'ve visited the centre have been tested by public health officials, etches said, as the remainder did not meet the criteria for testing. manitoba\\'s state of emergency and new restrictions on gathering in groups larger than 50 in response to the covid-19 pandemic may seem strict, but a political scientist says they could be the tip of the iceberg. leah west, an international affairs lecturer at carleton university, says provinces like manitoba are able to access a great deal of power in emergency situations, which could be exerted if the pandemic becomes more difficult to control. \"provinces aren\\'t going for the full sledgehammer right off the bat,\" she said. \"it could get more restrictive ... and we\\'ve seen that across the board\" in other jurisdictions, she said. on friday, the province announced it was declaring a 30-day state of emergency under manitoba\\'s emergency measures act. the province said it is also making orders through the public health act to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. dr. brent roussin, manitoba\\'s chief public health officer, said public gatherings will be restricted to 50 people or less at any indoor or outdoor place, including places of worship and family events. gatherings of more than 50 banned as manitoba declares state of emergency over coronavirus all bingo and gaming events, as well as gyms and wellness centres, were ordered to close immediately. the province is also working to reduce the number of people in restaurants, bars and movie theatres, by limiting the number of people allowed in to 50 or half the establishment\\'s capacity — whichever is less. public health inspectors and municipal law enforcement could be enlisted to enforce the public health order, roussin says. after friday afternoon, manitobans who aren\\'t heeding public health orders will be asked to comply. if they don\\'t, they could be charged or even face jail time. businesses around winnipeg are closing in response to the covid-19 pandemic, but the province ordered the closure of gyms on friday.

covid-19 pandemic. one could even say the videos are going \\'viral,\\' although that internet definition now takes a backseat to the word\\'s original meaning in the face of dangerous coronavirus. shyla tootoosis has received electronic messages from as far away as texas, germany and new zealand. tootoosis, 11, is one of hundreds of young girls who have, with the assistance of their parents, posted videos of themselves dancing and praying in their jingle dresses. \"it\\'s a really beautiful dance that provides healing,\" said tootoosis, who is from thunderchild first nation in saskatchewan. \"when i was growing up i was always taught to pray for one another, and it was a true honour to pray for the world.\" jingle dresses worn by women and young girls are commonly seen on powwow trails across north america. the dresses have metal cones stitched into rows or elaborate designs that jingle when the person moves. the shape and sound of the jingles is said to spread healing, whether dancing for one person or a whole nation. \\'dance that provides healing\\' call outs for jingle dress owners to dance in their yards for victims of the covid-19 pandemic spread on social media. the videos offer light in these unprecedented times, say its practitioners. \"when we saw the call for jingle dress dancers on facebook, i showed shyla right away,\" said shyla\\'s mother fatima tootoosis. \"she\\'s always taken on that responsibility and is the only jingle dress dancer in our family.\" kree spence, 6, another young girl who took part in the call out for healing in thompson, man., said jingle dancing makes her feel happy and she hopes it helps other people feel better, too. her mother charlene mcivor, who also has a five-year-old, said she and their father tell the children about mother earth and the pollution in the world.. \\'for mother earth\\' \"their dad teaches them cree and talks to them in cree so we keep that culture,\" said mcivor. \"we always want to keep her involved.\" mcivor said when she asked kree why she wanted to dance, she said, \"for mother earth. i want this virus to be over.\" she added that she also has to go back to school to learn because she has a lot of homework to do, her mom said. \"it was just nice that she was able to [dance] and bring happiness,\" mcivor said. \"there\\'s still good out there right now.\" \\'the call out\\' liz salway, from fort washakie, wyoming, in the wind river reservation, posted a call on facebook on tuesday evening for jingle dress owners to dance on their front porches at 9 a.m. the next day. the response was overwhelming. girls and women of all ages took up her challenge. salway said she had numerous dreams in 2017 about the healing dance. last year, at their community powwow, she saw the effect the healing dance had on diabetics and she became a real believer, she said. as people began self-isolating, she was trying to figure out a way to get the dance out to the masses. although salway is not a dancer herself, she has granddaughters who are jingle dress dancers, so she took to social media tagging friends and family members. \"we\\'re not only doing this for ourselves, but we\\'re doing this for the world because we need to be able to fight this sickness together and our native ways are the best ways to fight it.\" with files from samantha macaig more

those essential services. \"the plan outlines steps that we can take internally to redeploy staff or have people work different jobs, that kind of thing,\" said cameron. the plan would make sure the city would be able to supply essential services even if up to 30 to 35 per cent of city staff became sick. services that would be maintained include police, the fire department, water and sewer, and

(david blomme/nsha) it takes time to make sure the results you\\'re getting are accurate every time, heinstein said. \"if we have a new test, it\\'s very similar to getting a new car,\" he said. \"we have to take it for a test drive. we have to make sure the horn works, the brakes work.\" what happens to the swab? nova scotians who\\'ve been in close contact with someone who\\'s travelled internationally, and who have a fever and/or new cough, are being told to complete an online questionnaire before calling 811. if tested at one of the province\\'s assessment centres, the nasal swab ends up with heinstein\\'s team where it\\'s labelled and broken into several portions. the portions are placed in different containers, so the sample can be tested multiple times or be sent to the national lab in winnipeg, heinstein said. why it\\'s so difficult to get tested for covid-19 in canada staff get a result after extracting \"nucleic materials\" from the sample and amplifying its dna. medical laboratory technologist rob ring analyzes a sample at the qeii lab.

employees who can work from home, must [work from home],\" premier stephen mcneil said during a news conference friday morning. there remain no cases of covid-19 in nova scotia, but health officials said they fully expect cases to arrive here. to date there have been 226 negative lab tests. in an effort to mitigate the effects of the pandemic, the premier also announced that any student or child in daycare who travels outside the country must self-isolate for 14 days before returning to class or daycare. the premier said online education tools would be ramped up to help make sure students in grade 12 are able to get what they need to graduate on time. mcneil said schools would not be permitted to hold concerts, assemblies or other large functions, and lunch sessions would be arranged in such a way to prevent mass gatherings. public sector employees would continue to be paid while they are in self-isolation. mcneil said the government is not closing schools because there\\'s no guarantee people would have had sufficient time to self-isolate before returning to class. it\\'s also an acknowledgement that most students will not be travelling outside the country, he said. the premier called on the province\\'s universities and colleges to mirror the government\\'s actions with its own students and faculty. mcneil said the best thing anyone who travels can do for themselves and their neighbours is to self-isolate. \"if we wait until it\\'s here, it\\'s too late,\" said dr. robert strang, the province\\'s chief medical officer of health. strang called on people to continue good handwashing and other hygiene practices. the province has doubled the number of lines for 811 and has set up an online self-assessment tool. mcneil said the province is recommending public gatherings be limited to no more than 150 people. he\\'s encouraging all businesses to follow the appropriate protocols and said the government would revisit the situation if necessary. \"this

mcneil. strang said the government would become more directive with its protocols if that becomes necessary. the health protection act gives him the power, with the approval of the premier and health minister, to direct activities in an effort to prevent spread of disease, should that become necessary. strang said his office would be monitoring the situation and make changes as necessary. even

self-imposed quarantine to fundraise for coronavirus support and prevention. when gary liu returned from a trip to china in late january, he stayed home from work as a researcher at the national microbiology lab in winnipeg to make sure he didn\\'t start showing coronavirus symptoms. while in quarantine, he passed his time watching tv, sleeping, eating and raising more than $40,000 for people in wuhan, hubei, china — the epicentre of the coronavirus. \"winnipeg chinese community, they have good heart[s]. they generously show their love to people in wuhan,\" said liu, who spent his time in china in sichuan province in the luzhou and chongqing regions, which are about 1,000 kilometres west of wuhan. during his self-imposed quarantine in winnipeg, he tried to stay inside as much as possible, even ordering food and getting a friend to leave it at his door. it has now been two weeks and he is certain that he neither has the disease, nor has passed it along to anyone else. the disease has infected more than 45,000 people globally and killed more than 1,000 people, recent figures from the world health organization say. people kept asking liu how they could help people in china, so he got a fundraising committee together and gathered donations from individuals and businesses. \"i\\'m so proud that we have a good team,\" he said. he\\'s surprised by the amount of money raised in just 10 days. \"we care about china,\" liu said on cbc manitoba\\'s information radio. the fundraising campaign is ongoing. the money will go to the canadian red cross and toward buying and sending medical supplies to china. for the time being, we are in a new age of social distancing and restricted movement outside our homes. that said, most people only have a pantry stocked with supplies that will last a couple of weeks. this current new reality is a moment to take stock of how you buy food and how you prepare it. think about your food supply as perishables and non-perishables. in both cases, it\\'s important to look for nutrient-dense foods. with farmers\\' markets closed, your favourite vendor and neighbourhood butcher shop may have made special \"social distancing\" arrangements such as online purchasing and pickup so you can buy some local produce. a well-stocked larder focuses on non-perishable items like canned foods and dry goods such as pasta, grains and legumes which are easier to store and last a long time. without hoarding, stock up on cans of beans; there\\'s a wide variety. legumes like the chickpea come dried and in the can; the former requires soaking in water, while the latter can be used right away. many cooks will tell you that canned tomatoes are best for making pasta sauces, for instance, so make sure you have lots. if you have available freezer space, make frozen fruits and vegetables a staple item. there\\'s nothing wrong with frozen vegetables. research done at the university of california at davis showed that there is only a marginal difference in vitamins when it comes to fresh or frozen peas, corn, carrots, broccoli, spinach, peas and green beans, which are good for stews, as well as strawberries and blueberries. use a mix of fresh fruits and vegetables and canned goods or pasta to extend supplies. don\\'t be afraid to use frozen fruits and veg, andrew coppolino writes. (kory siegers/cbc) cook in bulk and get inventive whether it\\'s pasta, soups, casseroles or bakes, strive for one-pot style dishes that combine protein, vegetables and fibre. and make lots for re-heating later. whenever you can, prep one time for many meals; peeled potatoes and scraped carrots can be stored in water for later use. if you\\'re busy with kids at home or helping other family members, do as much as possible to cut down on the cooking prep-work involved at the same time you boost flavours: on your next trip to the grocery store, buy a variety of spices and dried herbs to experiment with their flavours. make sure you have a supply of aromatics: onions, garlic, carrots and celery are relatively sturdy perishables and packed with flavour. make a lot of rice for a meal and use the leftover portion for fried rice the next day. visit the international aisles at the grocery store: stock up on latin american, caribbean and indian ingredients to add variety and flavour to meals. buy some good protein powder and get out the blender: combine a couple of tablespoons with some frozen fruit, some spinach and a dollop of yogurt and you can make a delicious and nutritious \"shake\" that kids will love too. make some \"white\" chili with cooked pulled chicken breast to which you add some salsa and black beans. garnish with a dollop of sour cream. modify and adapt if you choose a simple meal of a canned stew, let\\'s say, you can stretch the amount by adding a bit of stock (look for \"no salt added\" versions) when heating it up. you can also boost flavours and serve more people by chopping up a potato and carrot or two, adding fresh or dried herbs and dashing in a bit of worcestershire sauce or a hot sauce for richer, fuller flavour. if you\\'ve roasted a chicken or brought home a whole roasted one from the store, pick any remaining meat from the bones and refrigerate it to add to a soup. put the bones in a large saucepan, add some herbs, cover with water and simmer to make a bit of extra stock. roasting a chicken? now might be a good time to try to make your own stock using the carcass.

(supplied by bin zhang) while at cfb trenton, zhang said the family was fortunate to discover a playground within their housing complex during their second week. \"we took her there pretty much every day, sometimes twice a day, just so that she can run around a little bit,\" zhang said. though there was a two-metre rule in place at cfb trenton, zhang said it wasn\\'t strictly enforced, and kids were able to interact on the playground. however, he said everyone wore a mask — including babies. quarantine was \\'bonding time\\' for family but zhang also said that time spent in isolation wasn\\'t all bad. his family enjoyed spending time together while sequestered — though their activities were limited. calgary family stranded in wuhan \\'relieved\\' as canadian airlift announced \"it\\'s a lot of bonding time with family members, that\\'s for sure. but on the other hand, you know, we did lose a bit of our freedom, because we couldn\\'t go out to enjoy our lives,\" zhang said. \"on the bright side, i think we were also keeping ourselves away from the virus, and we\\'re just very happy that we are all healthy in the end.\" through the journey, they also realized how fortunate they are. \"there\\'s so many people who love us, who care about us and has shown their love towards us, and [we\\'re] just really happy that there\\'s so much support to my family and to all the people under quarantine … at cfb trenton,\" zhang said. zhang offers advice for the newly quarantined — relax as the zhangs left cfb trenton, more canadians arrived friday for medical assessments before they were to be moved to the nav centre in cornwall, ont., for a 14-day quarantine. they had been airlifted from the diamond princess cruise ship, which has been docked in japan since feb. 3 over concerns about coronavirus. when asked what advice he would give other canadians who will be living under quarantine, zhang suggested that people try to relax; having a bit of free time is a luxury, he said. \"don\\'t see it as a quarantine, because, i mean, it\\'s not as bad as people make it,\" zhang said. \"there\\'s a lot of good people there helping you, supporting you, and you know they will be in good hands.\" no alberta cases yet alberta health services announced on friday that alberta continues to have no outbreaks of coronavirus. so far, 117 people have been tested,

maintain good hygiene. hinshaw also addressed the potential for social isolation and racism. \"i would ask that you don\\'t make assumptions about a person\\'s risk based on their ethnicity or country

relief, many are still facing an uncertain future. ottawa\\'s aid package includes the creation of the business credit availability program, which will allow for government corporations to provide $10

that\\'s the same conference that was attended by a sudbury man who later tested positive for covid-19, the city\\'s first confirmed case. \"the reason that i went for a test was i did have congestion

knowsophie grégoire trudeau tests positive for coronavirus ottawa\\'s medical officer of health, vera etches, took questions from our audience during cbc radio\\'s ottawa morning on friday, where she repeated her message to remain vigilant and limit contact with others. here\\'s a sample. her answers have been edited for length and clarity. q: how do we know [when] there is community transmission in ottawa, and how will we know if social distancing is working? a: we know from estimates how quickly travel-imported cases are likely to lead to other infections. we have enough information to say that covid-19 is being transmitted in our community. it\\'s not perfect information, so we want to keep working on our surveillance system. q: if a person tests positive for the virus and they are not exhibiting any symptoms, are they still contagious? a: people with mild symptoms who are positive can pass on the virus. we know with asymptomatic cases there\\'s a possibility of some transmission, but it\\'s likely it\\'s the very mild undocumented cases that are leading to transmission. q: my neighbour had a liver transplant and their spouse cannot work at home so is going to work. should the spouse be staying at home? a: ideally her spouse would not have to go into the community. they could try limiting exposure to each other within the home, but not everyone has the luxury of enough space to do that. q: can you go out jogging with a friend? a: yes, but a two-metre distance apart is recommended. a man jogs along a pathway in ottawa, tuesday march 17, 2020. (adrian wyld/canadian press) q: should your children be playing outside with other children? a: the less the better. there may be a single family within your close contacts and the two families can share and play back and forth. q: should grandchildren be visiting their grandparents even if the grandparents are healthy? a: only if you have to. use videos, send photos and make phone calls. a playground in dundonald park sits empty. schools will be closed in the city for at least the next three weeks. (francis ferland/cbc ) q: how do we cope with travelling on a bus, a plane, a train and even a taxi? a: in airport lineups, stand two metres apart. on the train, try to separate yourselves on the seats. the same thing on a bus. you will want to wash your hands as soon as you can after you\\'ve been on public transit. when you are in a taxi, put the windows down because it increases air circulation. if you\\'re ill, cover your nose and mouth. q: can the virus live on paper? is it safe to get the newspaper delivered? a: it will depend on the surface, on the temperature, and on the humidity. if you\\'re going to read a paper, wash your hands afterwards. q: should you wear a mask if you work in a retirement home? a: right now they\\'re asking everyone who comes into work to self-monitor for signs of illness, including taking their temperature regularly. masks are something employees can raise with their employers. q: my 95-year-old father lives in a retirement home. we are a family of four including an 18-year-old who just returned home from university. is my dad safer at the retirement home, or in our home? you need to consider which setting has the greatest risk that somebody might contact someone who is ill. in a retirement home they understand and are taking precautions. in our homes, it\\'s been harder for people to get the message that everyone must be limiting contact. vera etches, ottawa\\'s medical officer of health, provides an update on the first confirmed case of covid-19 in ottawa during a news conference on march 11, 2020. (sean kilpatrick/canadian press) q: how do i deal with pushback from an 18-year-old who doesn\\'t want to social distance? a: encourage them to connect over social media. q: i have family who live out of town and have been self-isolating for two weeks. can they drive here to visit? my husband is currently undergoing chemotherapy. a: i would not recommend it. your husband is in a situation where he is more vulnerable. even if your family has been isolating for 14 days, they might come into contact q: how long do you anticipate social distancing will be required? a: the province is looking at school closures until april 5, but the prime minister says it could be extended. the province has declared a state of emergency in response to the pandemic. public health officials in thunder bay,

(terri trembath/cbc) over at cochrane toyota, the dealership\\'s marketing director says staff are doing what they can to help — starting with offering to deliver toilet paper. \"we had some suppliers that had some excess that we could use and we took advantage of that and will see what we can do going forward, if we need to do some shuttling or getting things to places where people can\\'t leave,\" said kelly baum. \"it\\'s an easy one for us to do.\" baum says he\\'s hoping that by getting the word out, more businesses will jump on board. the town of cochrane, which declared a state of local emergency on tuesday, is encouraging residents to support local businesses by shopping local. the town has launched a new facebook page called shop cochrane, aimed at sharing information about how cochrane businesses are serving residents and what they\\'re doing to offer community support. \"no doubt, these are uncertain times for all of us and that includes business\" mayor jeff genung said in a recent facebook post. \"the town of cochrane is working to assist our local business community and we\\'re committed to doing our part through this challenging time.\" residents are encouraged to share their stories and update the latest information on service adjustments. with more daycares set to close in manitoba friday, health-care workers expected to work through the covid-19 pandemic want details on how they can access child care promised by the province. licensed daycare centres and preschools in the province will close on friday until april 10, although some may stay open for health-care and other essential workers, premier brian pallister announced tuesday. work was underway to \"ensure that child care will be available for our front-line emergency staff who need those services,\" pallister said. but essential workers want details on those plans. \"we\\'ve seen a huge uptick in terms of members reaching out to us in terms of what happens with that, can i use sick time, are there supports there?\" said bob moroz, president of manitoba association of health care professionals. the association represents respiratory therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, lab technicians and technologists. \"it\\'s an enormous issue that has certainly shown up on our doorstep with our members … who are parents.\" daycares, preschools to close after friday in response to coronavirus, manitoba premier says the province has updated its child-care phone line, where health-care workers can now leave a voicemail indicating their situation and need. the province has also asked all child-care centres to identify their front-line parents— nurses, nursing aides, police, paramedics, hospital cleaning staff, etc.— who will need support. letters have gone out to all health-care workers who are parents to identify need, said lanette siragusa, the province\\'s chief nursing officer. she met with families minister heather stefanson wednesday on the daycare issue, along with the human resources lead for shared health services and dr. brent roussin, the province\\'s chief public health officer. \"we will work with the individual sites in terms of essential workers in ensuring those workers have spots,\" siragusa said thursday. health minister cameron friesen said an update on childcare for essential workers is coming soon. 1st death, 3 new cases: what manitobans need to know about covid-19 but the manitoba nurses\\' union is also calling for action now. \"we need to see emergency child-care measures put in place that would allow nurses and other essential workers to serve the community as required during this time of need,\" said darlene jackson, the union\\'s president. she points to quebec, where the province has set up daycares for parents who work in health care and other essential services. \"nurses want to be there for patients, and be part of an effective response to the covid-19 outbreak. however, in order for nurses to work, many require access to reliable child-care services,\" jackson said. will you get paid if you self-isolate for coronavirus? it depends on wednesday night, shared health sent a memo to all staff, indicating that if they need to stay home during the pandemic to care for their children, they can use banked or vacation time, and can take unpaid leave once that\\'s used up. \"the employer is being uncaring,\" said moroz. \"people are feeling in a pinch, and they are feeling like they are on their own. is an elderly grandparent the ideal person to ask for child care in situations like this? we\\'re really looking for the employer to step up, and government as well.\" the union added workers would like an option like leave to be available so they can access employment insurance. the province says it is still taking an inventory of essential services workers who will need child care after march 20 and who cannot make other, short-term arrangements. parents who fall into that category should call 204-945-0776 or 1-888-213-4754 (toll-free), or e-mail to cdcinfo@gov.mb.ca. zhuo li recently returned to montreal from spending the chinese new year with family in sichuan province, china. he\\'s confident he did not contract covid-19 and at no point did the government ask him to go into quarantine, but out of a sense of duty he spent 14 days in isolation. li is one of many montrealers who have decided to quarantine themselves after visiting china as an extra precaution to prevent the spread of the virus. \"i feel i have an obligation to do that,\" li said. he was in china when the covid-19 outbreak started, though he said the region he was in had no reported cases at the time. still, he wanted to be sure he was symptom-free. i definitely don\\'t want to be responsible for the spread of coronavirus in quebec.- chen hong li said after he arrived in montreal, he drove directly home from the airport. his wife and daughter, who he lives with, had already left the house for an impromptu vacation to prevent any risk to themselves. after 14 days home alone, li is looking forward to returning to normal life and going back to work. all in all, \"it\\'s not so hard,\" he said, adding that he\\'s sympathetic for those who are in mandatory quarantine and who have it much worse. how would you spend 14 days alone? watch the video at the top of this story to see how zhuo li kept busy. zhuo li, pictured on holiday in sichuan province, china, returned to montreal in february after spending time visiting family. (submitted by xun li) another montrealer who recently quarantined herself is chen hong. she decided to stay home after returning from china in mid-february. she had been visiting family in her home province of heilongjiang. though canadian authorities have not imposed self-isolation on all returning travellers, and though hong doesn\\'t have any symptoms, she decided to isolate herself for a period of three weeks. \"even if i don\\'t think i\\'m sick, i don\\'t want to take any chances,\" said hong. \"i want to protect my colleagues and others. and i definitely don\\'t want to be responsible for the spread of coronavirus in quebec.\" chen hong said she doesn\\'t have any symptoms, but she\\'d rather be safe than sorry. she\\'s staying at home for three weeks to make sure she doesn\\'t put others at risk. (submitted by chen hong) hundreds of volunteers deliver groceries, other essentials nearly 500 members of montreal\\'s chinese community are working together to help community members who have decided to quarantine themselves. the group, which started on the messaging app wechat, is run on a completely voluntary basis. they ensure travellers who wish to self-quarantine have access to food, a way to get home from the airport and daily exercise without having to come in contact with the public. the group also keeps in touch with travellers to make sure they have groceries waiting for them when they land in montreal. for people who are already self-quarantined, volunteers drop off groceries on their doorsteps when they request it. \"it\\'s a very nice gesture from the chinese community because we take care of everyone\\'s health and we want to make sure that public health and safety has been reassured in montreal and in quebec,\" said said angela huang, who has volunteered with the group since its inception three weeks ago.. \"we also show people not to be afraid to come to chinatown or get close to chinese people because we\\'re not sick, and we\\'re doing everything to prevent the virus from coming to quebec.\" aside from the travellers\\' vital needs, volunteers also make sure they have access to entertainment through their wechat group. there, they share links to web tutorials and hold a daily yoga conference call. hong and others have been using the chat group and larger online community to learn new skills over their 14 days in isolation. she said she\\'s been watching videos to teach herself how to sketch and to play the ukulele. as people look to combat the spread of covid-19 by staying home, hamilton\\'s arkells have been running \"flatten the curve\" music classes online so fans can practise social distancing and jam out at the same time. the band posts chords to their songs across their social media accounts ahead of class time. then, lead singer max kerman follows up with a tutorial on instagram live, where his new crop of music students can log on, follow along and ask questions. anthony carone has also dropped in with keyboard tips and tricks. \"it\\'s a way to ultimately feel engaged and still feel a sense of community in a time where you can\\'t see people face-to-face,\" kerman told cbc news. updatedan up-to-date list of canadian live streams to watch during covid-19 in naming the sessions, the group has adopted the mantra to flatten the curve that refers to the epidemiological graph of a disease outbreak, which shows if the spread of a disease is slowed, it reduces the peak load on the country\\'s health-care system. since their days are usually packed with creative projects, when the arkells got word that they should be practising social distancing, kerman began the search for something productive to take on. so began their social media songbook to help others stay positive and to spread a little joy through music. \"i think music allows us a chance to … feel connected to other people,\" he said. \"when you\\'re hearing the stories that you hear through songs, and you\\'re able to relate to them, those are the things that keep me going.\" he said one of the most gratifying things the band gets to experience is people playing covers of their songs or asking questions. the arkells have been running daily classes since the weekend, much to the delight of their fans. it also helps that as the music community comes together, the event puts emphasis on the main objective: avoiding in-person interaction, but also avoiding isolation. viewers at home are being reminded about how the community can prevail in unprecedented times, with one person tweeting: \"these lessons are making me smile when i could really use it.\" kerman said that this feedback and walking through the behind-the-scenes with fans across the world has been the best part of it all. fans have tuned in from across canada, the united states, the united kingdom and even someone from their quarantine in italy. she\\'s since been tasked with translating the lyrics from arkells\\'s 11:11 into italian. this chapter is an opportunity for people to learn from each other\\'s experiences and to pick up an instrument that they\\'ve been meaning to play, kerman said. \"what i\\'ve been telling arkells fans is that anything we\\'re doing truly is not rocket science,\" he said. \"once you learn a g, c, d, e minor, a minor, you are ready to go, and you can learn a lot of your favourite music.\" \"there are silver linings to be found throughout all of this, and i think every day i\\'m learning something new about myself and something new i can bring into the world,\" he said. \"i think it\\'s really important to be mindful of the lessons we can learn right now.\" a tutorial session was held tuesday afternoon on the arkells\\'s instagram account. toronto\\'s michael garron hospital is planning to open a covid-19 screening and assessment centre in an east york medical building across the street from the hospital in mid-march. the screening centre for people with signs and symptoms of covid-19 would be located at 840 coxwell ave., the coxwell site of the south east toronto family health team. the building, south of mortimer avenue, includes a seniors active living centre run by woodgreen community services. mark fam, the hospital\\'s vice-president of programs, told cbc radio\\'s metro morning that the screening and assessment centre would have a separate entrance and separate space to protect the health of community members who use the building for other services. \"as we plan ahead, we\\'re looking to create additional capacity and space for folks who need to get screened or worried about getting additional testing, to make sure we still maintain the right capacity in our emergency department for other patients who are sick,\" fam said. \"patients who do need to go and get screened can still be separate from the rest of the community who might be going and accessing other services in the building.\" second opinionwhy doctors say we need to cast a wider net for covid-19 in canada6 more positive cases of covid-19 discovered in ontario\\'this will not be contained\\': experts cast doubt that spread of covid-19 can be stopped fam said the hospital considers the location to be suitable because it is within walking distance of its emergency department. people could get tested for covid-19 rapidly without going to the hospital itself, he said. the move would reduce the risk that patients with covid-19 spread the coronavirus to uninfected people in the emergency room. the hospital is working with the ontario health ministry on its plans, he added. mark fam, vice president of clinical programs, michael garron hospital, explains the plans to handle covid-19 assessments on a large-scale -- including the possibility of drive-through screening. 6:29 \"we\\'re looking to create afternoon services and evening, enable folks to come in, get an assessment by a physician and a nurse, get screened and testing if they need to, and if they need additional emergency services, be able to easily come across the street to the hospital. if not, they would be able to go home and get the results virtually,\" fam said. fam added that \"drive-thru\" testing is also an option being considered by the hospital. that means a person would get a quick assessment and quick swab while still in a vehicle, and that swab would then be tested in a laboratory. hospital to meet with tenants on monday on sunday, spokesperson for michael garron hospital shelley darling told cbc news that a meeting will be held with tenants of the building on monday to discuss plans and address any concerns they have. darling also said the same site served as an assessment centre during the sars and h1n1 outbreaks. hayley chazan, spokesperson for ontario\\'s health ministry, said michael garron hospital is one of a number of hospitals that have been asked by the ministry to set up screening and assessment centres. \"ontario is actively working with specific hospitals and has requested that they submit applications to establish dedicated assessment centres, which do not currently exist in the province,\" chazan said in an email to cbc toronto on the weekend. \"this is being done to help mitigate increased pressures on hospitals and emergency departments and to ensure ontario\\'s continued ability to effectively test and respond to potential cases of covid-19,\" she added. \"we expect plans for the establishment of assessment centres to be in place this coming week.\" the ministry did not say how many screening and assessment centres would be created. dr. david williams, centre,

(craig lee) lee boarded a bus for passengers who tested positive, while larry boarded one for those who tested negative. he said the passengers on his bus had to wear masks, while the driver, doctor and nurse on board wore hazmat suits. \"it was a little scary,\" he said. (craig lee) lee arrived at a new, as-yet-unopened facility at fujita university hospital, west of yokohama, after the trip, which took twice as long as it normally would due to the convoy. he said larry is staying on the floor below him and they communicate through whatsapp since they are restricted to their own floors. (craig lee) lee received a care package from care team japan, which was set up by the canadian embassy, upon arriving at the hospital. it included toiletries, a coffee mug, a t-shirt, some shortbread cookies, a kit-kat bar, earbuds and more. lee told cbc news network\\'s john northcott that it was \"like having christmas all over again.\" (craig lee) lee also sent along a photo of his dinner from thursday night — a far cry from what many canadians would think of when they imagine hospital food. (craig lee) canadian passengers from the quarantined diamond princess who had not tested positive for the virus disembarked on thursday and those who wanted to take a charter flight back to canada were taken to the airport in tokyo. that flight has taken off and is expected to arrive at cfb trenton in ontario early friday morning. the passengers will then be taken to the nav canada training institute in cornwall, ont., where they will be placed in quarantine for up to 14 days. lee, who was described as \"extremely positive\" but \"very emotional\" by northcott, said he and his travel companion will be quarantined for another week or two. lee said this experience won\\'t prevent him from travelling in the future — but said he\\'ll be cautious if he hears of any outbreaks abroad. two employees at cp rail\\'s calgary headquarters have tested positive for covid-19, according to a spokesperson. to the best of the company\\'s knowledge, the cases are unrelated, according to spokesperson salem woodrow. \"cp will continue to follow best practices to protect the safety and well-being of our employees,\" woodrow said in an email. \"cp took immediate action to thoroughly clean the areas the two employees frequented.\" the two employees identified those they were in close contact with, who were notified in turn. all have been asked to self-isolate and won\\'t return to cp offices until they are cleared by health authorities, woodrow said. \"even though the risk to other employees is low, cp is acting out of an abundance of caution and in the best interests of our workforce and their families,\" woodrow said. alberta reported 22 new cases of covid-19 on wednesday, as the number of confirmed cases in the province climbed to 119. in a news conference held wednesday, premier jason kenney said the province may not see the peak of the outbreak for another four or five weeks. what are the symptoms of covid-19?

(all images istock/getty images) stocking your pantry is a difficult task at the best of times. stocking your pantry during an emergency is even trickier. the stakes are higher, so it feels like a monumental task. what if you don\\'t buy the right ingredients to make a balanced meal? how many treats do you get? what if the doomsday preppers have already bought all the best stuff? canadians who have travelled internationally are being advised by health authorities to self-isolate for 14 days. similarly, anyone who has been exposed to someone with a confirmed case of coronavirus is also being advised to stay home. schools have closed, government offices are empty, businesses have sent their employees home. preparing a well-stocked pantry is a smart idea and it doesn\\'t need to be stressful. i connected with one of my favourite dietitians, danielle farrell, to give you some tips on how to properly stock up for two weeks. she\\'s going to steer you towards the nutritional suggestions, and i\\'ll be the captain of the good ship \\'flavour.\\' together, we\\'ve got you covered! danielle farrell is a registered dietician with dominion. (submitted by andie bulman) 1. take inventory make a list of what you already have. start with the dried goods. odds are you have some baking supplies, bags of beans, dried grains, rolled oats, and a few treats. this is a good starting point. you probably have more food than you think! while doing this, check the best before and expiry dates — and toss anything that isn\\'t safe. 2. meal planning is key danielle\\'s a planner who recommends taking the time to sketch out some meal ideas. \"using what you have as inspiration, consider batch-cooking and freezing things like chili, soups, and casseroles,\" she told me. \"make a list based on what you choose. making a list will help to prevent panic-shopping or stocking up on things you don\\'t need.\" 3. clear out your refrigerator and freezer you need two weeks\\' worth of groceries — maybe more. toss out that jar of kimchi you opened and then forgot two years ago. nobody likes to waste food, but fridge and freezer real estate is about to become very important. check your expiry dates here too. i mostly pay close attention to best before dates, but i\\'m a tad relaxed with yogurt. 4. don\\'t forget to replenish pantry staples \"it\\'s really important to grab some things that you don\\'t always think of on a weekly grocery trip,\" said danielle. that applies to cooking oils, spices, sauces, stock and similar ingredients. if you like to bake, she said, \"make sure you have baking powder, yeast, flour, sugar, and so on.\" 5. plan to cook (but also plan to be a bit lazy) if you end up being isolated, you\\'re probably going to want to take on a baking or cooking project during that time. maybe you\\'ll tackle homemade bread, or try your hand at a long, simmering curry. regardless, you should get ingredients for an all-day project. similarly, danielle urges you to buy ingredients rather than instant or pre-made food. \"when you plan to cook, you have so much more variety in your meals,\" she said. \"instead of buying 10 frozen pizzas, grab a variety of meat, cheese, vegetables, and grains such as tortillas or flatbread, so you can make your own pizzas or wraps.\" i\\'d like to interject here and encourage you to grab one or two frozen pizzas. fourteen days is a long time, and having a few convenience meals on hand for days when your kids are bored, finished with their respective lego projects or are bouncing off the walls is smart. sometimes you just need to shove a pizza into the oven. andie bulman checking the best-before date on a pantry item. (submitted by andie bulman) 6. some healthy food, please i know we all went nuts for bread, eggs, cigarettes and booze during the state of emergency in january, but i beg you to grab some healthy proteins, as well as whole grains, vegetables, and healthy fats. we\\'ve attached a short list below as a resource. use it as a guide! i know that when times are tough, i always reach for treats, but an important part of this whole thing is to keep ourselves healthy. 7. frozen vegetables are fine frozen vegetables need a new pr person. most are frozen at peak ripeness and retain most of their nutritional value. additionally, frozen produce prevents food waste, as the shelf life is much longer. if you buy a bag of combined frozen diced onion, red pepper and celery mix, you\\'ll already have a good base for soup or jambalaya. buying a few bags of frozen vegetables can also save you time! 8. get a few treats we\\'re not telling you to buy half the chip aisle in a blind panic, just grab a few things that you know you\\'ll crave and appreciate. make your treats count! i\\'m planning to grab salted dark chocolate, aged cheddar and a good bottle of red. get stuff you really want. it\\'s a tough world out there right now, but if you just do a few things you\\'ll feel a bit better. wash your hands, don\\'t check your investments, and stock that pantry. a few key staples you\\'ll need for what may feel like a long haul. (submitted by andie bulman) pantry list of some key staples: protein foods, whole grains, canned veggies and fruit canned fish (tuna, sardines) packed in water. great for sandwiches, salads or casseroles dried or canned beans, peas, lentils and beans. use in soups, salads, grain bowls, tacos and chili eggs, greek yogurt, cheese, milk or milk alternatives fresh meat, poultry and fish (portion and freeze) rice, quinoa, barley, bulgur, farro, whole grain pasta whole-grain bread (freeze some for later) crackers, cereal, rolled oats for baking more columns by andie bulman tinned vegetables with no salt added frozen vegetables (diced onions and diced butternut squash are staples in both our kitchens) longer-lasting fresh vegetables: potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, beets, carrots, cabbage, onions canned fruit packed in water and unsweetened apple sauce frozen fruit (eat as is, blend into smoothies, or add to yogurt) longer-lasting fresh fruits include oranges (they last three to four weeks in the refrigerator), grapefruit (six weeks) and apples (four to six weeks). unripe green bananas will take two to five days to ripen, and can be used in baking if they become overripe let\\'s not forget treats! make these count by purchasing the stuff you really want and will really look forward to. read more from cbc newfoundland and labrador the latest: canadians who cleared medical screening disembark after 2-week quarantine on diamond princess. charter flight for eligible canadians en route to cfb trenton in ontario. 47 canadians among more than 630 people from the cruise ship to test positive for coronavirus. local media report that 2 japanese passengers who tested positive have died. 1 new case in b.c., bringing total in canada to 9. no one under quarantine in trenton, ont., has shown symptoms, health minister says. canadian passengers from the quarantined diamond princess cruise ship in japan who did not test positive for the coronavirus are on a charter flight that took off from tokyo airport and is expected to arrive at cfb trenton in ontario in the wee hours of friday morning. cfb trenton was the destination for previous repatriation flights that brought people back from wuhan, china — the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. but instead of staying there, the diamond princess returnees will be transported to the nav canada training institute in cornwall, ont., where they will be placed in quarantine for up to 14 days. foreign affairs minister françois-philippe champagne tweeted that the plane was \"wheels up\" on thursday afternoon. canadian passengers from the diamond princess cruise ship arrive to board a plane at haneda airport in tokyo. they are now in the air and expected to land at cfb trenton in ontario just after midnight friday.

(hallie cotnam/cbc) but in the end, covid-19 made the decision for the mchale family. \"it\\'s common sense. it\\'s not a hard decision to make when when people\\'s lives are at stake. yes, your livelihood is going to be affected. but to find out that somebody ever got sick from one of our parties? mother and i are both getting glassy-eyed. that\\'s how important this is to us,\" billy said wiping away a tear, just like his mother. \"there are people throughout the world worried about their families\\' ability to stay alive. there are people stranded in foreign countries. there are people not able to work. we\\'re worried about a party? and when you put it in perspective, that\\'s really what it is.\" the mchales insist the douglas tavern\\'s famous st. patrick\\'s day party is just postponed, not cancelled. \"we don\\'t know when, but we will have one. even if it\\'s september,\" evelyn said. and the decorations? time to take them down? \"no, they\\'re staying.\" the mchales say they\\'ll still find time to raise a glass to st. patrick\\'s day. \"we\\'ll do it ourselves,\" evelyn laughed. \"around the kitchen table.\" sláinte, indeed. the hiram walker and sons waterfront distillery will be adding hand sanitizer to its production line as a way of fighting the spread of covid-19. \"in coordination with local and senior levels of government, we are utilizing our production capacity and windsor distillery to help provide hand sanitizer to areas where it is in need,\" said corby spirit and wine, the company which manages the hiram walker distillery, in a statement on thursday. with hand sanitizer in short supply, this london pharmacy made their ownnova scotia distillers shift production from booze to hand sanitizer the hand sanitizer will be produced in conjunction with hiram walker\\'s regular products, according to the distillery\\'s manufacturing manager han ha — and will be donated \"where needed\" in windsor, as well as to the ttc in toronto. according to ha, the team at hiram walker met with officials at windsor mayor drew dilkens\\' office to identify where bottles of hand sanitizer would be most needed, including police and fire stations, hospitals and the canadian border services agency office. han ha, manufacturing manager for hiram walker & sons, says the distillery is currently sourcing out other ingredients that are needed to produce hand sanitizer. (submitted by han ha) \"we do have the luxury ... that we have the main ingredient in making hand sanitizer — and that is our alcohol. we just have to source out some other ingredients and we will do it in our facility,\" said ha. he added operations at the distillery \"have been busy,\" because ingredients like peroxide and gelling materials are in short supply. calgary distillers, brewer shift to producing hand sanitizer during outbreak \"a lot of these ingredients out there are in demand. so we are trying our best to secure as much as we can and turn this around as quickly as we can,\" said ha. \"the packaging itself is one of the challenges that we have right now. we\\'re not sure how we\\'re going to distribute this. but what we do have is the capabilities of making it. we have the equipment to make it.\" the hiram walker distillery is a local landmark — but not everyone gets to venture inside. this is the massive fermentation hall, home to 39 tanks. for his part, dilkens said he expressed great support for hiram walker\\'s decision to produce hand sanitizer. \"when they called me and said, \\'we want to talk about making hand sanitizer in this distillery, how much could you use?\\' i said, \\'how much could you make?\\'\" dilkens explained. ttc spokesperson stuart green said while the transit service is currently \"well-stocked\" on hand sanitizer, the company was happy to take up corby on its offer — since some transit employees have been supplying their own personal bottles of sanitizer. \"it sounds like they\\'re producing quite a bit and they\\'re prepared to give us a good portion,\" said green. \"if we can supply our customers or our employees with more hand sanitizer, that would be great in terms of that supply.\" this is very generous. thank you!! <a href=\"https://t.co/jf0wr2wgrd\">https://t.co/jf0wr2wgrd</a>&mdash;@ttcstuart it\\'s not clear how the hand sanitizer will be distributed between customers and employees, green said, but that is currently being assessed. hiram walker and sons is expected to make its hand sanitizer available by the end of next week. adoptions are on hold and pet shelters across the country are scrambling to make ends meet to take care of their animals during the covid-19 pandemic. humane society offices in calgary, edmonton and toronto are closed to the general public. volunteers have been sent home and dogs and cats already at the shelters are going to have to wait before getting a chance to find a new home. \"we really just don\\'t want people coming in and out of the building, so unfortunately all of our animals ... are staying put,\" said jessica bohrson, communications manager for the calgary humane society. \"it could potentially be months. it\\'s anyone\\'s guess right now.\" bohrson said staff are making sure shelter animals are fed and looked after. if the pandemic with its restrictions lasts too long, they\\'ll have to find a new way to do adoptions. \"we would hope that we could figure out something that we could make work to get animals into their forever homes.\" the toronto humane society has come up with an innovative way to continue adoptions. \"the toronto humane society actually will be doing adoptions on a digital first-come, first-served basis,\" said public relations specialist hannah sotropa. \"we\\'ll be conducting interviews via phone and scheduling meet-and-greets in person to the shelter in an effort to proceed with adoptions in some capacity.\" sotropa said staff are making sure the animals get their \"walks and loves\" every day. \"our animals obviously don\\'t know there\\'s a pandemic going on, nor do they understand what social distancing is.\" we want to make sure that we\\'re able to care for the animals we have with us right now.- liza sunley the toronto humane society is still running a pet food bank. \"during these hardships, we can\\'t forget those tummies also need to be fed and so we will be handing out food, outside of our building, for ... people who are on low income or feeling temporary hardship.\" the edmonton humane society has turned to foster families to help reduce animal numbers at the shelter. ceo liza sunley said it\\'s important to make sure there is space for new animals if needed. \"we know that the need for the services we offer doesn\\'t go away just because we have these sorts of situations,\" she said. \"we want to make sure that we don\\'t get to the point that we\\'re overcapacity. we want to make sure that we\\'re able to care for the animals we have with us right now.\" premier and chief medical officer warn peak of covid-19 outbreak may be weeks away alberta oil and gas \\'on life support\\' in wake of economic blows, premier says none of the shelters are allowing people to walk in and turn in a pet, but the animal groups are all willing to look at surrenders if it\\'s an emergency. none of the humane societies receive government funding and rely on public donations. the vancouver humane society doesn\\'t take in animals. it depends on public support to provide services such as the mcvitie fund, which provides financial help for people whose pets need emergency veterinary care. \"if that funding drops off, it would mean someone who can\\'t afford veterinary care might be forced to surrender their pet to a shelter, which we obviously want to avoid, especially under these current circumstances where animal companions are especially important to people,\" said peter fricker, projects and communications director. \"we\\'re hoping that people won\\'t forget about animal charities and will continue to donate as much as they can.\" as the covid-19 pandemic grows, aid groups are popping up in saskatchewan to help those who may need groceries, medication or just plain old social interaction. kale maclellan says the group she started to help others is also helping her manage her own mental health. maclellan, a student at the university of regina, started mutual-aid treaty 4 on monday. as of wednesday afternoon, the group had nearly 300 members. \"it\\'s really, really easy to feel so overwhelmed by all of this,\" maclellan said. \"being able to really immerse myself in connecting people and seeing other people help each other has helped me so much.\" maintaining mental health and mindfulness during the covid-19 pandemic maclellan deals with anxiety. with her classes at the university cancelled, she is in isolation at home with her six-year-old son for the time being, something she said makes it easy to get caught up in the worry. she said her son understands what the virus is but hasn\\'t quite grasped why they can\\'t go out and hang with friends. \"feeling like i\\'m helping right now has actually just helped me personally feel like i\\'ve got something to focus on, i don\\'t need to be thinking about everything that\\'s on the news and on my newsfeed on facebook,\" she said. the group hasn\\'t had a lot of calls for help, maclellan said, but there have been plenty of people offering their help or sharing information. \\'i just wanted to make myself useful\\' up in saskatoon, similar groups are forming. a group of law students formed a help group on facebook called yxe community response covid-19. will hampton, one of the students helping out, said he knows immuno-compromised people in his life so the virus has been on his mind for some time. \"i just wanted to make myself useful because i know that we need people who are able to organize and able to take action during this time,\" he said. the group has a web order form on facebook as well as a phone line they\\'ve set up. hampton said the thing they need the most help with is driving and delivery at the moment, but that other places in the city need help too. \"i know kids help phone needs people to help volunteer there,\" hampton said. hampton is hoping to partner with other organizations that specifically help seniors and vulnerable people, as that\\'s their focus right now. sask. businesses using new tech, old-school delivery to stay afloat in age of self-quarantine maclellan said her regina group is also becoming a place of community action. they\\'ve started a petition asking the rentalsman to ban evictions in saskatchewan and she wants to do more of that work in the future. \"now is definitely a time for us to be looking at the root causes of these problems and how we are failing our fellow community members, and how in turn that affects us as a society,\" she said. \"we have a chance right now to … be working together to make tomorrow or when this ends a more equitable and better community for everyone.\" as canada\\'s first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in ontario, at least three major medical supply stores in winnipeg say they are sold out of the n95 face mask. 19 in ontario being investigated for coronavirus after 1 case confirmed, 1 presumed at the stevens home medical supplies store in the health sciences centre, general manager rick stephens said last week, 20 boxes each containing 50 masks flew off the shelf in a single day. \"we can\\'t keep any on the shelf. we are completely out of inventory. out of 10 calls coming in, nine are going to be in respect to face mask inventory,\" said stephens. the n95 offers the best protection and has the highest filtration, he says. all of his boxes of surgical procedure masks that don\\'t offer as high a level of protection as the n95 are also gone. see a demo: at the stevens home medical supplies store in the health sciences centre, general manger rick stephens said last week, 20 boxes each containing 50 masks flew off the shelf in a single day. 0:55 masks are flying off shelves in b.c., but using them has \\'no proven benefit\\' against coronavirus stephens says most of his customers are looking to purchase masks to send to family in china, because of shortages there. \"one gentleman was very distraught over the whole issue of not being able to get masks. he was very tearful about the issue,\" said stephens. \"we have a huge empathy toward their needs but our hands are bound to what we can get for them.\" stephens says a couple of customers wanted to buy his entire inventory, but company policy prevents him from selling large volumes to one individual. he says retailers learned from the h1n1 crisis in 2009 where companies bought up all the masks and then resold them for huge profit. stephens compares what he sees happening now to the h1n1 crisis. health officials confirm 6 cases of swine flu in canada \"we are starting to see the same ramping up we saw exactly during h1n1. we had people coming in looking for product themselves for their own protection. and then all of a sudden we had others coming in wanting to buy everything in sight. and that is exactly in canada the direction we are going again. and yet nothing actually has been declared in terms of a pandemic here in canada,\" said stephens. stevens home medical has 100 cases of each mask on back order. customer april scott noticed the sold out sign on the door of the business. she was glad to have gotten a mask from the respiratory clinic where she had an appointment. \"having a respiratory illness, i have to be more cautious,\" she said. over at innovative medical supplies on henderson highway the story is similar; manager albert amante says both mask types are also sold out. \"someone wanted to order 2000 masks. one hundred boxes of isolated face masks or surgical procedure masks and 40 boxes of n95. i told her they were on back order,\" said amante. he said some of his orders are destined for china, others to the philippines because of the recent volcanic eruption. amante says while he isn\\'t hearing panic, he is hearing urgency. \"they want to get their hands on a physical barrier. people need to realize the n95 does offer protection, but it\\'s ... not 100 percent foolproof that it will prevent this flu,\" said amante. will face masks protect you from the flu? the province agrees. in a written statement a provincial spokesperson says the risk of coronavirus in manitoba is considered low. the statement goes on to say, \"it is not clear there is any significant benefit to wearing masks to prevent influenza or influenza-like illnesses including the coronavirus in the community setting.\" good hand hygiene is known to provide significant protection from viral respiratory illnesses, the province said. people are encouraged to regularly wash their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand cleaner after coughing, sneezing, caring for a sick person, while preparing food ,and after using the toilet. other measures include avoiding close contact with anyone showing signs of a respiratory illness such as coughing or sneezing. at least three major medical supply stores in winnipeg say they are sold out of the protective n95 face mask. most of them have been bought to send to family members overseas. 2:06 how about a game of where\\'s waldo? kait qadri has made a life-sized waldo which she will be hiding around her property on woodlawn drive in sherwood for folks

elected for four years and we\\'re also aware that the premier does have the opportunity to call it [before] the oct. 26 date if he chooses,\" moe said. when reporters continued to press moe, he replied that an election could be called early but there are still discussions to be had. \"as i said, if there is anything contrary to oct. 26 you would be among the very first to know.\" [moe] should be straightfroward with the people of saskatchewan.- ryan meili, leader of the saskatchewan ndp moe said on friday economic unrest\" caused by blockades in support of wet\\'suwet\\'en hereditary chief could play a factor in an early election. moe also mentioned covid-19, otherwise known as the coronavirus, as a potential election trigger during last week\\'s availability. the premier then backtracked on monday, when he clarified his statement about the role covid-19 would play in an election call, saying it \"will not be a factor.\" moe said five different jurisdictions in the country have minority governments which makes everyone prepared to campaign at all times. he said the \"choice\" for voters is more important than when they vote. budget and pending election loom with spring sitting for sask. legislature set to start today the saskatchewan party holds a seat advantage of 46 to 13 over the ndp. the government has also confirmed 55 of 61 candidates for the upcoming election so far. the ndp has 30 nominated candidates. \"it\\'s pretty clear the premier is playing political games when it comes to the question of election timing,\" said ndp leader ryan meili on monday. \"he should be straightforward with the people of saskatchewan.\" saskatchewan\\'s last general election was on april 4, 2016. if oct. 26, 2020, is election day, there will have been

first laws passed by the new government and a campaign promise. in debate as the opposition leader in april 2007, brad wall said, \"a brand new saskatchewan party government is going to bring into effect in this province set election dates so all of the taxpayers and private citizens will know when and be in charge of when the election is going to be held in the province of saskatchewan.\" wall was critical of ndp premier lorne calvert saying in the house the ndp could push the election call into 2008 and serve a five-year term. minister of justice don morgan said in debate in april 2008, \"no longer will the most basic and vital democratic right be held hostage by political considerations and influences.\" \"no more delaying going to the polls. no more judging the political winds, trying to guess when the best time to face the voters is. we made a promise and we kept it,\" morgan said. in the house on apr. 15, 2008 during a debate on fixed election legislation, known as bill 4, ndp mla warren mccall said: \"i want to make very clear, we\\'re definitely not in favour of fixed election legislation.\" patients in manitoba can now attend their doctor\\'s appointments over the phone or by video chat, a move meant to decrease face-to-face interactions due to covid-19 concerns. \"in an ideal world it\\'s always preferable to have face to face contact,\" said dr. fourie smith, president of doctors manitoba. \"but we currently face a unique set of circumstances.\" it might take a few days for each individual family clinic to set itself up for virtual appointments, according to dr. smith, who is also a family physician in winnipeg. in the next couple of days, patients will likely be contacted by their family physician\\'s office and offered the option to choose a virtual consultation if they want, he said monday. 1st death, 3 new cases: what manitobans need to know about covid-19canada to bar entry to travellers who are not citizens, permanent residents or americans dr. smith added virtual doctors appointment are just an option, and they might not work for all patients. in-person appointments in manitoba are still continuing. \"certain medical conditions absolutely will necessitate a hands on examination by a physician, and those things will not change,\" he said. doctors manitoba says there won\\'t be any relaxing of rules around writing of prescriptions, and some people will be still required to see their physician in person. there will be no relaxing of standards around writing prescriptions, he said, although there are some medications already that can be filled without an in-person doctor\\'s visit. \"that certain standard of care will be able to be provided through the telephone or through videoconferencing,\" he said. how virtual appointments will actually work is dependent on the clinic specifically, he said. patients should call ahead to see if their appointment can be done virtually. province, doctors agree on billing for virtual appointments the concept of virtual care isn\\'t new, and is already in use in other provinces. it\\'s something that doctors manitoba has been pushing for a while, dr. smith said. doctors manitoba and manitoba health announced monday they had reached an agreement so physicians could bill the province when they provide virtual care, including telephone consultations and video conferencing. \"what has only happened now, i think, is the matter has been brought forward much sooner than anybody had anticipated, and it\\'s certainly something we hope to continue to provide in the future,\" he said. the hope for doctors manitoba, which represents more than 3,000 physicians in the province, is to make virtual appointments available as broadly as possible, from community family doctors to the hospital. chinese-american director lulu wang\\'s movie the farewell won the top prize at the independent spirit awards on saturday, while adam sandler was named best actor and

(terry roberts/cbc) \"we learned that the more you can control the environment, the more you can keep [lobsters] alive — it\\'s the reason we built a better facility,\" said jarding. \"we have no intention of repeating those mistakes.\" numbers on the rise in the last six years, lobster landing volumes have increased 117 per cent, from 2,138 metric tonnes in 2014 to to 4,644 metric tonnes in 2019. while an impressive increase, those volumes are still small in comparison with the rest of the atlantic provinces. in 2017, the total volume of lobster harvested in newfoundland represented just three per cent of what was harvested in the atlantic provinces. another encouraging statistic: from 2014 to 2019, the total lobster value has increased from $18 million to $60 million, according to the department of fisheries and oceans. david decker, secretary-treasurer of the fish, food and allied workers union, says he expects the landed value of lobster in newfoundland and labrador to exceed $100 million in five years. (danny arsenault/cbc) it isn\\'t just quin-sea fisheries that has high hopes for the crustacean. other harvesters and seafood processors are optimistic, too, according to david decker, secretary-treasurer of the fish food and allied workers union. \"we are projecting that in five years, this fishery in the province will exceed $100 million in landed value, which is phenomenal, quite frankly,\" decker said. \"because of global warming, the resource itself is moving farther north all the time every year.\" counting young lobsters arnault lebris, a researcher at the marine institute in st. john\\'s, also thinks lobster has a bright future in the province. he studies the impact of warming waters on the lobster population in newfoundland. last summer, in three designated study areas in the province, lebris and other researchers paired up with local fishermen — a partnership organized by the ffaw — to count the number of baby lobsters, hidden inside rock-filled, metal cages on the ocean floor. arnault lebris, a researcher at the marine institute, says lobster production could potentially double over the next decade. (marie isabelle rochon/radio-canada) \"it gives us an idea of the abundance of density of young lobster in the region,\" lebris explained. in placentia bay, the results were less than stellar. hawkes bay was better, but in st. george\\'s bay, the results were stunning. that area yielded on average one young lobster per cage, and there were 40 cages — a similar density to the maritime provinces. his hypothesis is that newfoundland\\'s ecosystem might become more welcoming for lobster in years to come because of warming waters. \"there are more days in the year where water temperature could be between 12 and 18 degrees, and we think it helps larva survival,\" lebris said. a young lobster, like this one held by lebris, takes five to seven years to become fully grown. (submitted by arnault lebris) that kind of research will help the industry in the years to come, according to lebris. \\'\\'we will be able to see trends\\'\\' he said, which will be an important tool for harvesters who are thinking of buying a lobster harvesting licence or for seafood processors thinking about investing more in this lucrative fishery. how the coronavirus is affecting lobster shipments a speed bump of sorts to live lobster exports that is being watched very closely by people in the industry is the coronavirus, the flu-like illness that can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms. to date, the number of confirmed cases in china has moved beyond 14,000, while the death toll is more than 300. infections have been reported in 23 other countries, with nearly 150 confirmed cases and at least one death outside china. n.s. lobster shipments to china drop \\'dramatically\\' due to coronavirus canadian lobster exports boom amid u.s. trade tensions with china nova scotia is already feeling the impacts as lobster sales and shipments to china have been halted because of the virus. \"it\\'s a market problem. the citizens and people are restricted in travel and they are not going out to eat,\" said leo muise of the nova scotia seafood alliance. a similar impact is not being felt by lobster exporters in newfoundland, like quin-sea fisheries, because direct flights to china with live lobsters onboard won\\'t resume until later this year and the harvesting seasons for lobster are different in this province than nova scotia. \"[this virus] goes beyond business.… it seems like a world concern,\" said jarding. \"i think we will have to adapt to this situation.… [we\\'re] trying to prepare as good as we can.\" lobsters are in demand. halifax stanfield international airport is spending millions on an upgrade so more cargo flights can deliver lobster to china and other asian countries. (cbc) for now, the numbers are encouraging. \"we think that it can grow, the production might double and the lobster might become one of the most important fisheries in newfoundland, maybe the most important in around ten years,\" said lebris. read more from cbc newfoundland and labrador the parent company that owns tim hortons and two other prominent restaurant chains says sales declined at the coffee chain last year, even as it continued to add locations. restaurant brands international, which owns tim hortons, burger king and popeyes chicken, revealed in its annual earnings release on monday that tim hortons sold a little over $6.7 billion us worth of coffee, donuts and other food items last year, a decrease of 1.5 per cent from the previous year\\'s level. tim hortons had 4,932 stores as of the end of 2019, a slight increase from 4,846 locations as of the end of 2018. at tim hortons canadian locations, sales fell by 4.6 per cent in the last quarter of the year compared to the same period a year earlier. tim hortons president alex macedo leaving in march, parent company says tim hortons normally makes up almost two thirds of rbi\\'s entire revenues, but the sales slump at tims comes at a time when the other two franchises are growing. burger king saw its sales grow by 3.4 per cent last year, while popeye\\'s grew by 12.1 per cent. growth in those two chains coupled by the sales slump at tims has prompted the company to rethink its strategy and get back to basics, the company said in a release. it plans to accelerate a roll out of fresh coffee brewers for better-tasting and more consistent coffee quality, said ceo jose cil said. the chain also plans to start offering more than one type of milk for customers, including skim milk and a dairy alternative, almond, starting this spring. \"these adjustments may seem basic, but that\\'s the point: being the absolute best at the basics that we\\'re already famous for,\" said cil. tim hortons launches timbits breakfast cereal on the breakfast front, tim hortons is working to improve the quality of bacon in its sandwiches. the company will transform nearly all its drive-through boards to digital from paper, he said, which will allow it to tailor offerings based on location, time, weather and other factors. tim hortons is also shaking up its loyalty program, which it says has more than 7.5 million active members but only about a quarter who shared contact information. the new program will be based on points rather than visits and make most of the menu items available for redemption. when the company starts the roll-up-the-rim contest in the coming weeks, it will have been updated to tie into its digital focus, and will help drive digital adoption and loyalty registration. the rewards program is expected to continue to drag down sales for several quarters. tim hortons removes beyond meat offerings from remaining locations \"burger king delivered its strongest year of restaurant growth in the last two decades,\" cil said. \"popeyes launched an iconic chicken sandwich that has proven to be a game changer for the brand in every way.\" \"at tim hortons, our performance did not reflect the incredible power of our brand and it is clear that we have a large opportunity to refocus on our founding values and what has made us famous with our guests over the years, which will be the basis for our plan in 2020.\" across all of its brands, rbi reported net income of $257 million or 54 cents per diluted share for the quarter ended dec. 31, down from $301 million or 64 cents per diluted share in the same period in 2018. despite the lower profit, rbi hiked its dividend policy for 2020. it will now pay 52 cents per share per quarter. the company did not say whether tim hortons, which has about 30 stores in china mostly in the shanghai region, has seen any impact from the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.'"
